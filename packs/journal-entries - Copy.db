Obviously, in practice, the numbers vary significantly from individual to individual. If you wish to randomly create Characteristics, subtract –10, then add 2d10. So, a Characteristic of 30 translates to 2d10+20. If a Characteristic starts at 5, roll just 1d10 to randomise it. This can even be used to create PCs out of traditionally NPC species by using random Characteristics and adding an appropriate career, creating, say, an Ogre soldier, Skaven engineer, or Vampire noble.

The wizards of the Light Order are sometimes known as the White Wizards or hierophants. Their especial study is knowledge and for this reason they are also called the Order of the Wise. The colour of the robes of the Order are brilliant white, and a serpentine staff is often carried.</p><p>The energies of <em>Hysh</em> are the most elusive of all kinds of magic. They quickly penetrate solid things and soak away, even into the rock beneath the ground. Light Magic is reckoned to be the most difficult to master; spells that bind the Wind of <em>Hysh</em> are elaborate and ritualistic.</p><p>Because of this, there are many acolytes and lowly wizards at the Light College whose duties are to keep up a chorus of incantations which is sung constantly, night and day. They also ensure that the thousands of candles and lamps are kept alight, that the incense burners are full of offerings, and that chimes are struck at appointed ritual hours.</p><h3>Semiotics of the Light Order</h3><p>The symbols of the First Lore are many, and the most important is the Serpent of Light. The College’s rune is a curiosity, for it little resembles the serpent that it represents. For Light Wizards, its form underpins their belief that they are the most accomplished and learned of wizards, for the rune seems to indicate one preeminent lore atop the Wheel of Magic. Whilst this belief might seem conceited, it carries a kernel of truth. Light Magic is hard to detect and even harder to master. Moreso than other wizards, Light Wizards must commonly act in concert to best harvest the wind they work with.</p><p>Rumour has it that many of Light College’s teachings come from a source other than Ulthuan. Indeed many hierophants’ trappings, titles, and rituals echo magical practices of lands far to the south. The precinct of the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.DZjpSLYGD7mTKNmP]{Light College in Altdorf} is startling in appearance, with its buildings and monuments seemingly transported from the deserts of ancient Khemri, or even constructed from light itself.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>A Difficult Wind</em></h3><p><em>Hysh is justly considered the hardest of the eight winds to work with and control. Casting Tests and Channelling Tests using the Lore of Light suffer a penalty of -1 SL in most conditions. Tests made to perceive Hysh using the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent, such as Perception, Intuition, and Track Tests, suffer a -2 SL penalty.</em></p><p><em>You can offset this penalty with the aid of a College-trained acolyte. If another character in the vicinity of a Light Wizard has the </em>Channelling (Hysh)<em> Skill and passes an <strong>Easy (+40) Language (Magick)</strong> Test, the Light Wizard may negate these penalties if the assistant’s voice can be clearly heard. Provided they pass the Test, the effect lasts until the assistant stops chanting. If they stop for any reason, they must begin a new chant and pass another Language (Magick) Test.</em></p><p><em>For this reason, hierophants often travel in the company of an apprentice and, despite their reputation for being learned, are rarely welcomed at Verenan Temple-Libraries.</em></p><p><em>This may seem an unfair burden on Light Wizards. GMs should keep in mind that whilst </em>Hysh <em>is elusive, it also penetrates the ground and drifts to areas far from the poles. So whilst it is always hard to control, it may reach places other winds cannot.</em></p></blockquote><h3>A Light Touch</h3><p>The Order of Light’s apprentices are called acolytes, and there are more apprentices in this order than any other. They are typically younger as the Order of Light rarely accepts apprentices in their teenage years or older, preferring to mould acolytes from a young age.</p><p>Housed in sparsely decorated barracks, their life consists of an unending series of repetitive tasks and studies — ensuring candles are kept lit, incense burners filled, and bells rung at the right time. Acolytes form the choirs which sing the chorales that keep the walls of the Pyramid of Light intact, or the hymns that help senior wizards to manipulate <em>Hysh</em> in different ways.</p><p>The college’s acolytes contemplate <em>Hysh</em>, learning meditation and concentration, and practise working in teams to assist the senior wizards. Unique among the colleges, acolytes learn to channel magic not only to feed their own spells, but to feed spells cast by senior wizards. Acolytes hardly have any time off, and are rarely allowed to leave the college grounds, except in the company of a senior wizard.</p><p>It’s not the sort of life that attracts many high-class folk or the nobility. However, the prospect of a roof over one’s head and three nutritious, although bland, meals a day is enough to entice lower-class children. The order actively recruits their acolytes from among these classes, even scouring the orphanages of Altdorf and other cities a couple of times a year, looking for children with latent magical talents.</p><h3>The Wanderer's Path</h3><p>Most acolytes fail to progress. They might rise to a position of senior acolyte, but only a few of them have the capacities and aspirations to become a proper wizard. Those who do tend to have a calm demeanour and rarely show their emotions — the result of both their years of training as an acolyte and of their exposure to <em>Hysh</em>. This serene disposition lends them grace and authority.</p><p>As a wizard, they are allowed to leave the college grounds, and even encouraged to go and experience the outside world. They learn about the Empire during this period, about the people who live there, and about the dark forces that threaten them. These years of wandering are the ultimate test for aspiring hierophants and determine what kind of wizard they will become.</p><p>Those who return from their <em>Wanderjahr</em> have several paths available to them. Some come back to Altdorf and lose themselves in theoretical study. These scholars seek to better understand magic and to develop even greater insights into the workings of the Winds of Magic in general and innovate ways to oppose Chaos. Others stay out in the field, either becoming exorcists intent on seeking out the dark practices of Chaos, Daemonology, and Necromancy, and destroying them. Others act as advisors to noble courts and otherworldly powers. A few white wizards make a career as battle mages in the Imperial armies.</p><p>The hierophants that find a career outside Altdorf usually come back to the College of Light every few years, learning about improvements in the use of <em>Hysh</em> and sharing the experiences they have had since their last visit. These visits are usually simple stays-overs of individual wizards but can also result from organised yearly group reunions or large conferences. Whatever form they take, these visits are expected of white wizards, and are meant not only as an opportunity to share knowledge, but also to keep relationships between members of the order close and warm.</p><p>Novice hierophants generally go out on their own during their <em>Wanderjahr</em> and the first couple of years afterwards. But as they learn the heavier spells that need to be fuelled with considerable amounts of the Light Wind, they usually get one or more acolytes assigned to them, to help them channel <em>Hysh</em> into those spells.</p><p>Senior hierophants can rise to the position of Lord Magister. These senior wizards form an advisory group for the head of the order, the patriarch. The current patriarch is Vespasian Kant, who lived as an orphan in a workhouse in Marienburg, where his talents for magic and eagerness for study was recognised by a visiting hierophant. Kant was sent to the Order of Light in Altdorf, where he proved to be a talented and diligent student who quickly rose through the ranks.</p><p>It was Kant who, in 2507 IC, discovered that then-patriarch @UUID[JournalEntry.QHdHDll8yI5CSNQl.JournalEntryPage.FzslF56xVepqMZFm]{Egrimm van Horstmann} secretly worshipped Tzeentch, and exposed the cultist. In the resulting chaos many senior hierophants were shown to be corrupted by van Horstmann. In the end, the remaining Lords Magister elected Kant as the new patriarch of the order.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":325000,"name":"The White Wind","type":"text","_id":"jAdFKOHJLcLUW3zt","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><em>Hysh</em> is the lightest of the Winds of Magic. Floating high in the air, it drifts from the Warp gates all over the Old World, as far as Araby and Nehekhara, where it settles in the scorching desert. No other wind reaches so far in useful quantity. Ancient Nehekharan sorcerers discovered that the wind concentrates around certain geometrical shapes, and built pyramids and obelisks to capture it.</p><p>Next to those shapes, the wind is also attuned to the colour white, to sunlight, to mirrors and lenses, and to harmonious sounds like music and songs. Wizards have observed the calming effect <em>Hysh</em> has on people who gather to listen to music.</p><p>The White Wind is almost invisible, even for those with the sight. It shows itself as a lightly glowing haze, but because it tends to accumulate in bright, sunlit places, it is difficult to spot. Even when noticed, the wind’s fleeting nature makes it difficult to manipulate. When casting major spells and rites a light wizard uses a choir of acolytes whose harmonic chorales channel the wind.</p><p>When controlled, however, <em>Hysh</em> can light up dark rooms and uncover hidden objects. With greater intensity it blows away disguises and illusions, as well as the dark forces of Chaos. In very high concentrations, however, it blinds those who can see it and strips away any illusions wizards have about themselves, to reveal the bare reality of who and what they are. Only the most strong-minded individuals (or, it is said, the humblest ones, those who have no allusions about themselves) can stand this self-scrutiny.</p><p><em>Hysh</em> has three domains. The first one is illumination, both literal and metaphoric. Hysh can bring light to dark environments and makes visible what is hidden or obscured. It banishes the darkness in peoples’ minds, illuminating illusions and falsehoods.</p><p>The second is the domain of healing, protection, and preservation. This is not a healing of the body — such as is associated with <em>Ghyran</em> — but a healing of the mind. <em>Hysh</em> can remove mental anguish, can inspire and enthuse, embolden people, and even protect them against the debilitating effects of fear and terror.</p><p>The third domain is that of exorcism. The concentrated power of <em>Hysh</em> burns away Chaos and banishes Daemons. Few creatures of Chaos can withstand its searing light. This property makes <em>Hysh</em> perhaps the most powerful weapon mortals may wield against the Ruinous Powers.</p><h3>The Light College</h3><p>The buildings of the Light College are some of the most peculiar in the Empire. The sphinxes and obelisks that occupy the campus make one think that a piece of ancient Khemri has been transported to Altdorf. The two great alabaster pyramids in the middle of the square only reinforce that image. Few Altdorfers feel comfortable in this foreign place, where the air is filled with the constant singing of acolyte choirs. And those Altdorfers don’t even see the third, giant pyramid. That one is fabricated from <em>Hysh</em>, invisible to those without @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f.JournalEntryPage.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#second-sight]{the Sight}.</p><p>The third patriarch of the order, Immanuel Rauenscheid, devised the college’s architecture. Before becoming patriarch, he had travelled to Nehekhara and Araby, where he learned how the ancient Nehekharans could accumulate and control great concentrations of <em>Hysh</em> through architecture. Back in Altdorf, he designed buildings that would achieve the same, enabling his students to more easily study <em>Hysh</em>. It seems to have worked; the Light Wind, normally scant under the grey skies and roiling fogs of Altdorf, is nevertheless present in the city.</p><p>The two visible pyramids are carved from magically reinforced alabaster, so intensely white that they almost seem to emit light. The entrance is marked by large silver doors, engraved with the signs of the Tree of Knowledge on the doors of one pyramid, and the Tower of Isolation on the doors of the other. Inside, the pyramids are a warren of twisting corridors leading to large, sparsely decorated but well-lit halls and scores of private rooms for the hierophants who reside here. For those who don’t know their way it is easy to get lost. Furthermore, it is difficult to hide, as there is light everywhere.</p><p>The walls of the third pyramid are made of the light of <em>Hysh</em>. Hierophants maintain ongoing rituals, fuelled by the wind that is channelled by chorales of acolytes. This pyramid of light sits atop underground vaults within which are held numerous magical artefacts and entities, some so strong that only the concentrated power of <em>Hysh</em> can keep them imprisoned. If the rituals that strengthen the walls were to falter, it could mean disaster, for the College, for Altdorf, and for the Empire as a whole.</p><h3>Relationships</h3><p>The College can sometimes be seen as aloof, but nevertheless cultivates many important relationships.</p><h4>Chaos</h4><p>The powers of Chaos stand for everything white wizards abhor. Where <em>Hysh</em> stands for enlightenment, order, and healing, Chaos stands for obfuscation, disorder, and destruction. White wizards are sworn to fight Chaos in all its forms.</p><h4>Military and Nobility</h4><p>The skills of hierophants make them a welcome presence in Imperial armies campaigning against the forces of Chaos. The military respects Light Wizards, who often make the difference between a hard-won victory over Chaos and utter defeat. For the same reason these wizards are often found at noble courts, especially those in the northern provinces of the Empire. There, where Chaos is more prevalent, Light Wizards help identify and combat this threat in all its forms. They illuminate the wilderness where Beastmen roam and unmask mutants and Chaos cultists in settlements and cities around the Empire.</p><p>These activities have earned them a good reputation, and a willing ear from the Emperor and his advisors at the court, who appreciate the wisdom and calmness of the Order of Light’s patriarch. However, van Horstmann’s unveiled corruption has tarnished that reputation. </p><h4>The Witch Hunters</h4><p>Although Light Wizards and witch hunters fight the same fight, there’s little trust between the two. Witch hunters tend to mistrust wizards in general, whether licensed or not. The hierophants have received special attention since many notable magical heretics have arisen from within the ranks of the Light Order, such as High Luminary Horx and Egrimm van Horstmann. Suspicious as witch hunters are, they suspect that behind the Light Order’s outward display of purity hides a tendency towards corruption.</p><h4>The Loremasters of Saphery</h4><p>High Elves, on the other hand, respect the Order of Light — or at least the contempt they have for Humans is somewhat less for hierophants. Where most Humans have a poor understanding of the Winds of Magic, these wizards can control the most ephemeral of the winds. The Elves feel that the white wizards’ views on magic are closest to how they themselves see these forces.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Ashamira Dib","type":"text","_id":"aYLoTGlJDjlTCm2U","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/actors/ashamira.webp\" width=\"237\" height=\"268\" /></div><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.JrH67vCaUXSF7YQq]{Ashamira Dib}</p><p>At a young age @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.JrH67vCaUXSF7YQq]{Ashamira} stayed at the edge of society. She moved into the mountains and became a hermit. She found a place near a spring and started an ascetic life there, basking in the hot dry sun of the country, at a place where <em>Hysh</em> was abundant.</p><p>A traveller came to visit @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.JrH67vCaUXSF7YQq]{Ashamira}, claiming to have tracked her down by observing currents in the flow of <em>Hysh</em>. The traveller was swathed in robes of pure white linen, and only their kohl-rimmed eyes gave any sign that a living being inhabited the robes. Ashamira could not tell whether they were man or woman, Human or Elf. But they proved an excellent tutor. And yet, after a year and a day of instruction, Ashamira woke to find the traveller had moved on.</p><p>Her own reputation had grown. Supplicants came to consult her and ask her for guidance and for healing. @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.JrH67vCaUXSF7YQq]{Ashamira} had found her role in society. Meanwhile, she started having dreams and visions of a pyramid built completely of <em>Hysh</em>. That pyramid of light seemed a key to a deeper understanding of the white wind.</p><p>Then disaster struck. A regiment of the Undead crossed the mountains and invaded part of Araby. Coming in forces that were too large for her to fight. They killed her followers and destroyed the villages where they lived, and even with the power of <em>Hysh</em> she was unable to stop them.</p><p>It was then @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.JrH67vCaUXSF7YQq]{Ashamira} understood she had to learn even more about <em>Hysh</em>, about how to use it to combat and destroy the Undead. And that she wouldn’t learn that on her own. She knew that she had to find that pyramid of light.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/spot-hysh.webp\" width=\"253\" height=\"151\" /></div><h3>Ashamira as Patron</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.JrH67vCaUXSF7YQq]{Ashamira} is on her way to Altdorf, to the pyramid at the @UUID[.jAdFKOHJLcLUW3zt#the-light-college]{College of Light}. She has crossed the Southern Sea that separates Araby from the Old World and travelled northward through Tilea. Characters can get involved with her as she travels to Altdorf — perhaps the College of Light has even asked them to accompany her, or to investigate her. They might meet her in the south of the Empire, making her way up north, to Altdorf. And she will need their guidance. Her command of Reikspiel is poor and she knows little of the customs and traditions of the Empire. She has learned, though, that her main talent — wielding magic — is not allowed without a licence.</p><p>She needs protection, for not only the @UUID[.jAdFKOHJLcLUW3zt#the-light-college]{College of Light} has heard of her. Necromancers who fear her powers may stop her before she reaches the capital. Witch hunters warily follow her, waiting for the first sign of her using unlicensed magic. Even some in the White Order itself may oppose her, fearing that her quaint source of knowledge may upset the orthodoxy of the order. Accompanying @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.JrH67vCaUXSF7YQq]{Ashamira Dib} towards Altdorf can thus lead to a fair number of adventures.</p><p>In return she could help the Characters, whether on the way to Altdorf or when she has arrived there. She is a specialist on the threats posed by Khemri. She has a fine nose for the foul stench of their wicked magic and a wide knowledge of the most effective ways to oppose both their sorcery and several types of Undead. She can teach Characters how to spot necromancers and fight them. In addition, she can be a teacher (although an unorthodox one) for any Character aspiring to be a wizard.</p><p>Once in Altdorf, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.JrH67vCaUXSF7YQq]{Ashamira} can be a powerful contact for the Characters, and she can introduce them to other hierophants. Next to that, she needs people to help her navigate Imperial society, and who can accompany her on her travels and missions. She is not the type to just stay at the college grounds and study there — she’ll want to travel around and learn more of the Empire or go on missions to defeat necromancers. When she does, she will need company.</p><p>She’s also as close to a specialist one can find in Altdorf on Khemri. People with plans to start a military or treasure-hunting expedition to Khemri might want to consult her. Perhaps she will even send adventurers there, asking them to bring back certain powerful items from the ancient Nehekharans, which are now lost in the ruins of Khemri.</p><p>Eventually @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.JrH67vCaUXSF7YQq]{Ashamira} will want to return home and help the people there fight the foul forces from Khemri.

Each Advance you take in a Skill improves the odds of succeeding with appropriate tasks — Characters who are well trained or experienced may be able to best opponents who are more naturally gifted.</p><h3>Determining your Skill Level</h3><p>All Skills are associated with a single Characteristic, noted in the Skill’s description. A Skill’s rating is determined by taking its associated Characteristic and adding the number of Advances taken in the Skill. Space for recording your Advances for each Skill is provided on your Character Sheet.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Sigrid has a Fellowship of 41 and has taken 5 Advances in Charm, so her Charm is 46 (41+5=46).</em></p><h3>Basic and Advanced Skills</h3><p>Skills are classified as either <em>Basic </em>or <em>Advanced </em>.</p><p>Basic Skills represent innate or common abilities that you might practice in day-to-day life. Basic Skills can be Tested even if you have taken no Advances in them. To do this, simply attempt a Test using the Characteristic associated with the Skill as described in @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.lQThXbnpgQ30VBXR]{Rules}.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Sigrid has no Advances in Athletics. However, as Athletics is a Basic Skill, she can still Test Athletics using the Characteristic associated with it: Agility.</em></p><p>Advanced Skills require specialist knowledge, training, or first-hand experience to even attempt to use. You may only Test an Advanced Skill if you have taken at least one Advance in it. If you have not, you cannot attempt to Test the Skill. So, no matter how intelligent you are, you will not understand the finer points of law without the Lore (Law) Skill.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Adhemar has an Intelligence of 36 and no Advances in either the Basic Gamble Skill or the Advanced Heal Skill, both based on Intelligence. He can Test the Gamble Skill at 36% as it is Basic, and anyone can Test Basic Skills. The Heal Skill is an Advanced Skill, so Adhemar has no idea how to patch up wounds beyond screaming loudly for a doctor!</em></p><h3>Grouped Skills and Specialisation</h3><p>Some Skills are classified as Grouped . This means the Skill is an array of related Skills under one heading. Each related Skill is called a Specialisation . When a Specialisation is mentioned in the rules, it is marked in brackets.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Language is a Grouped Skill, thus represents many related Language Skills under a single Skill heading. Examples of the different Specialisations of Language are: Language (Bretonnian), Language (Magick), or Language (Mootish).</em></p><p>When you gain an Advance in a Grouped Skill, you must allocate the Advance to an appropriate Specialisation. Sometimes the Specialisation options will be marked clearly in your Career, so you simply select one of the options on offer. In other cases — such as when a Specialisation is marked as ‘Any’, meaning you can choose one Specialisation — you will need to select a Specialisation yourself; should this be required, either refer to the relevant Skill description and choose from the sample Specialisations found there, or, with GM permission, create a unique Specialisation that fits the Skill and best suits your character. </p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Theodora has a choice of Lore (Any) in her career. When she allocates an Advance to that option, she has to decide which Lore Specialisation to take. After some deliberation, she chooses to advance her Lore (Theology), showing she has learned something of the Gods.</em></p><p>Other than that, Grouped Skills are handled in exactly the same way as normal Skills, with each Specialisation handled like a unique Skill.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Sigrid has 8 Advances in the Basic Skill, Entertain (Singing), but nothing in Entertain (Acting). This means she Tests her Fellowship of 41 when attempting to act, and Tests 49 when singing (41+8=49). By comparison, Theodora has a single Advance in the Advanced Skill Animal Training (Pigeons), but no Advances in Animal Training (Horses). This means she can use the Skill to train her pigeons to drop bombs on unsuspecting enemies, but she cannot train her horse to do the same, as she has no idea how to train horses.</em></p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>COMBAT</em></h3><p><em>Many Skills might also have some application in combat; suggestions for how to do this are marked in each relevant Skill entry.

You then guess that target amount and the GM will tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal. Each SL from your initial Bribery Test gives you another guess. At the end of this process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what you have gleaned.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman; a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for Income. The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is 21 Brass. Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman, and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required. Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price. Snorri’s first guess is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’. His second guess is 40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’. Snorri now knows he must bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim high, and offers 30. Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through.</em></p><p>In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight, but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation.

The symbol of the Fifth Lore is the Sword of Judgement and the wizards of the order wear grey robes. Of all the wizard orders they are the most secretive and are not widely trusted or liked by common folk, who regard them as secretive and scheming. They are called Trickster wizards in scorn, though they prefer to refer to themselves as the Grey Guardians.</p><p>Grey Wizards often set out on expeditions under the cover of darkness, implying great or perhaps even sinister goals. Yet they do not talk easily of their deeds, or of other matters much, for they are aware of the distrust they inspire and prefer to remain inconspicuous. Their powers do not lend themselves well to the favour of ordinary folk, being bound up in spells of concealment, illusion, and lies.</p><p>The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.okUSd5mPWGgjTqpZ]{Grey College} itself is a worn and shabby stone building found in the back alleys of Altdorf ’s @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.LqyTrO7VNeMDukKY]{Hexxerbezrik}, its poorest and most disreputable district. The City Watch prefer to keep out of this area, and no honest citizen would ordinarily risk entering such a den of rogues. The building is not large and its appearance resembles those beside it. Grey Wizards come and go by secret entrances situated in the surrounding streets, and it is suggested that a network of tunnels run from beneath the building and throughout the city.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Chasing Shadows</em></h3><p><em>To those attuned to magic, the magical energies of </em>Ulgu <em>shift across the ground like a roiling mist. It is most affected by the mortal winds that blow across the world, and it rears into mighty clouds beneath the influence of storms. Yet it is at its most potent in the still, dank fogs that bring a chill to the air and hide everything in a cloak of shadow.</em></p><p><em>Channelling (Ulgu) Tests benefit from +1 SL when the weather is appropriately stormy or foggy. They suffer from –1 SL on sunny days, or when a light breeze banishes the clouds.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Semiotics of the Grey Order</h3><p>The Sword of Judgement is the symbol of the Grey College. It is in equal parts promise and threat, for a sword can be wielded in defence or in judgement, and Grey Wizards involve themselves in the prosecution of both. The orientation of the sword, its point directed downwards, is no accident. It serves as a reminder to both noble and peasant that the justice of the Grey Wizards hangs over their heads, ready to strike at a moment’s notice.</p><p>There are many other meanings to the sword, and the Grey Wizards use it prominently to mark meeting places, ritual circles, and other places of power. Even the slightest alteration of the symbol’s rendering can significantly alter the message it conveys — provided one recognises the details of the code. Few folk outside the Grey College know more than a handful of iterations, and most of those scraps of knowledge are deceptions set by the Grey Wizards to lead others astray.</p><p>True to their order’s symbol, Grey Wizards usually carry swords, though often concealed beneath their robes.</p><h3>Acolyte in Shadows</h3><p>Apprentice shadowmancers typically travel with their master. They are not schooled in classes in the college, but rather accompany their tutor on their travels. In this way they learn not only about the Grey Wind, but also about the Empire and its inhabitants. A shadowmancer usually has, at most, one apprentice who follows along on their travels, and the lessons are typically in the form of learning by doing, having a practical bent without much theoretical foundation — although the long days of wandering the Empire’s roads can be filled with philosophical discussions about the nature of magic and of mankind. Even so, shadowmancers are not known to be great theoreticians.</p><p>This way of teaching forges an intimate bond between apprentice and tutor. It also makes for very independent shadowmancers.</p><p>No two wizards of the order look or think alike — there are many shades of grey, they like to say. That said, wizards of the Grey Order do share some characteristics. During their travels together, a shadowmancer gets to know the disposition of their apprentice, and ultimately decides whether they are well suited for a career in wizardry.</p><p>This depends not only on whether the apprentice is talented enough, but also on whether they have the right attitude. If the wizard concludes that their apprentice is ready, they travel back to Altdorf together, to the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.okUSd5mPWGgjTqpZ]{Grey College} grounds — it is often the first time that an apprentice visits them. There, the apprentices will get a few weeks of intense training and tests, at the end of which they are assessed again for their aptitude to become a member of the order. Those who aren’t fit are sent away.</p><h3>Leadership Philosophy</h3><p>Grey Wizards in general don’t aspire to positions of power or wealth — something that they could easily attain, given their aptitudes. But shadowmancers recognise such positions as traps that would bind them and take away their freedom. Neither do they mingle in local politics, other than in the service of protecting the Empire. Again, they see committing to a cause as giving up freedom.</p><p>Besides these philosophical reasons, the tenets and strictures of the Grey Order also forbid its members to engage in these activities. The order is very strict in upholding these laws. Its @UUID[JournalEntry.4spGTAnh7qc2JDqY.JournalEntryPage.XqOkYrrp82Ktyszq]{Magisters Vigilant} actively roam the Empire, looking for signs of shadowmancers abusing their power. If they find them, that shadowmancer often vanishes without a trace, as if they never existed.</p><p>The Grey Order is sworn to defend the Empire against its enemies, a task its members take seriously. That said, loyalty to the Empire is, for the shadowmancers, not the same as loyalty to the Emperor. For many Grey Wizards, Emperor Karl-Franz is not necessarily the embodiment of the Empire — the Empire is much more than just its head. It is just as much the people making a living in the cities, the farmers who work the land, or the soldiers who defend it.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Grey Wind","type":"text","_id":"5K7JQ1NIreen3VoG","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><em>Ulgu</em> is a heavy wind, a thick, sombre, murky fog that crawls sluggishly over the ground, like a wall of impenetrable grey that leaves people who are caught in it confused and deluded. The wind is often found together with natural mists, although it is difficult to say whether it is drawn to those mists, or whether it generates them. Some wizards have reported seeing figures moving in the clouds, but no one has determined whether these are real creatures living in the magical mists, or whether <em>Ulgu</em> is playing tricks on them.</p><p>This wind can be found in the haze of predawn darkness, creeping away when the sun rises. It can be seen in dark and misty woods, in foggy swamps, and in the crepuscular alleyways of poorer urban quarters, where the houses are stacked together so tightly that they block the sunlight and keep the streets in permanent twilight. It is also drawn to places where people are deceived or where objects are concealed — the small rooms and sparsely lit corridors of the Imperial Palace, for example, where politicians plot and make shady deals, in the halls of merchant houses, and around the market stalls of charlatans. For those with @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f.JournalEntryPage.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#second-sight]{the Sight}, traces of <em>Ulgu</em> are often signs of bad intent.</p><p><em>Ulgu</em> does not only deceive individual people, it can keep secrets hidden for whole towns, or even from an entire society. For example, it is said that the Fimir, the mist devils that are rumoured to live in the bogs and fens of the Wasteland, and whose matriarchs can create supernatural mists, use a magic that is powered by <em>Ulgu</em>. The Grey Wind hides their existence and conceals any trace of them.</p><p>The Skaven, perhaps the Empire’s biggest secret, are heavily cloaked in <em>Ulgu</em>. Despite the increasing meddling of the ratmen in Human society, their existence is still largely unknown and stories about them are written off as fantasies, delusions, or bogeyman tales told to frighten children into obeisance.</p><p>This collective refusal to acknowledge the existence of the Skaven is a trick that <em>Ulgu</em> plays on the collective mind of society. It is kept in existence, rumours say, by a great ritual the Skaven perform every year in Skavenblight, their capital hidden in the foul heart of the Blighted Marshes. But then, these rumours themselves may be tricks suffused with Ulgu.</p><p>Then again, perhaps such creatures do not exist at all, <em>Ulgu</em> merely fooling the ‘enlightened’ into thinking that they do.</p><h3>The Grey College</h3><p>The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.okUSd5mPWGgjTqpZ]{headquarters} of the Grey Order is set in a maze of alleyways in a poor and shabby quarter of Altdorf ’s @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.LqyTrO7VNeMDukKY]{Hexxerbezrik}, where the streets are dark, damp, and foggy. Stories abound about Chaos creatures and Daemonic manifestations in that area, but another tale says that the shadowmancers spread these rumours themselves to scare people away. Whatever the truth, the effect is that few people venture into this area of the city. Even the brave sentries of the Altdorf Watch are hesitant to enter this maze of twisting, winding alleyways.</p><p>The college building itself certainly does not seem out of place with its surroundings. It is a ramshackle stone building with moss-covered, crumbling walls, a leaking roof, and a family of barn owls that has taken over the single tower that hasn’t yet collapsed.</p><p>Inside, the building looks as decrepit as from the outside. Dusty, mouldy corridors lead to cobwebbed rooms with holes in the floor and sounds of creaking floorboards and of footsteps just around the corner can be heard over the whistling wind. It certainly doesn’t look like the headquarters of one of the most powerful covert organisations in the Empire, which is exactly the way the Grey Order wants it.</p><p>Although the jumble of rooms and corridors make for an impenetrable maze that bewilders the uninitiated and uninvited visitor, members of the Grey College easily find their way around and into the secret passages that lead to the real college underneath the ruin — most of the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.okUSd5mPWGgjTqpZ]{Grey College} is underground, with broad, well-lit corridors, comfortable rooms for resident and visiting wizards and large meeting halls. From this place, underground passageways lead to secret entrances all over the quarter.</p><p>The college building is not large, though. It doesn’t have to be large, as shadowmancers spend most of their time outside the college, but the building has enough room for the few permanent residents and for the members who pass through Altdorf on their travels.</p><p>Shadowmancers are expected to revisit the college every few years and report what they have learned in that time. These reports are said to be stored in the Hall of Records, a library which houses many secrets that, people say, could bring most noble families down if they became general knowledge.</p><p>The grounds are also rumoured to house a great library with many rare and curious volumes of secret lore and ancient mysteries, but the locations of both this secret library and the Hall of Records are only known to a few of the resident wizards and hidden to anyone else.</p><h3>Relationships</h3><h4>Soldiers and Spies</h4><p>Like all wizards, shadowmancers are expected to serve the Empire for several years, fighting its enemies. But where other orders do so mainly in the military, the Grey Order is more apt to serve in covert missions, seeking out the invisible enemies within the Empire rather than fighting the visible ones outside it. As such, they have good contacts with the Imperial spy networks, like the Black Chamber who welcome Grey Wizards into their ranks. It helps the Grey Order to learn how these organisations work and get to know people there, which is quite handy because many of them end up as advisors to those services.</p><h4>Skaven</h4><p>There are stories of shadowmancers being in contact with the Skaven, helping them to keep their existence a secret, and even to assist them on certain of their missions. It is not because the Grey Order underestimates the threat that the ratmen pose — quite the contrary. However, instead of alerting the Imperial court, they rather obfuscate the existence of the Skaven, preferring to lull them into a false sense of security, over scaring them deeper underground. It makes it easier to spy on them. The Grey Order is especially interested in the yearly ritual that the Skaven perform to cloud the minds of mankind, keeping their existence a secret to the public at large. Grey Wizards think such magic could be useful, in the right hands.</p><h4>The Cult of Verena</h4><p>The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon.JournalEntryPage.9bWE0Ayt5XGQf50r]{Cult of Verena} is markedly chilly towards the Grey Order. Verenans respect truth and dislike illusion and misdirection. They therefore find the practices of the Lore of Shadows distasteful on an ideological level. They also resent the Grey Order’s adoption of the Sword of Justice as a symbol. Followers of Verena tend to hold the view that for justice to be done it must be seen to be done, and the shadow games of the Grey Order are an insult to this principle. Most Verenans overlook these differences, conceding that both the Cult of Verena and the Grey Order ultimately serve civilisation, but some hardliners seek to undermine, and even destroy, the Grey Order.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Immanuel-Ferrand Holswig-Schliestein","type":"text","_id":"x7CnGtdKM9pTxuT6","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/actors/immanuel-ferrand-holswig-schliestein.webp\" width=\"246\" height=\"302\" /></div><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.1Fw8roY9zezj0jAn]{Immanuel-Ferrand Holswig-Schliestein}</p><p>Immanuel-Ferrand is also a member of the Grey Order, but whilst he is proud of his accomplishments as a wizard, he is by no means a master of <em>Ulgu</em> and has not made great efforts to climb the hierarchy of shadowmancers. He claims that there are conflicting interests between the order and his first duty as High Chancellor. There is some truth to this, the Grey Order are not widely liked and Immanuel-Ferrand does well to downplay his involvement, but privately he believes they hold the key to the Empire’s security and survival.</p><p>Unfortunately for @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.1Fw8roY9zezj0jAn]{Immanuel-Ferrand}, he is currently compromised. He used his influence to persuade Karl-Franz to depose the Jungfreuds of Ubersreik. Immanuel-Ferrand believed they were planning to wage war on their neighbours, but this was due to his being fed judiciously selected evidence by his rivals in the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.W4LFOIduFZoqSNsN.JournalEntryPage.e1vvDKWEn2EYw0gZ]{Black Chamber}. Despite his intellect and wide portfolio, Immanuel-Ferrand is naïve and easily led. He has been unguarded about voicing his opinion that the Empire would be stronger if the Emperor could rule as an absolute monarch, and this habit has given his enemies invaluable insight into his character.</p><p>The civil strife that resulted, in part, from Immanuel-Ferrand’s blundering rumbles on. He does not know how he was manipulated but he realises he has made himself a pariah, both at court and within the corridors of the @UUID[.5K7JQ1NIreen3VoG#the-grey-college]{Grey College}.</p><h4>Immanuel-Ferrand as Patron</h4><p>The events of <strong>Empire in Ruins</strong> bring @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.1Fw8roY9zezj0jAn]{Immanuel-Ferrand} into contact with the Characters, and he may employ them if they prove themselves capable agents. The Characters may be pleased to gain the attention of such a powerful man, only to discover that their benefactor is increasingly friendless and isolated. There are several things Immanuel-Ferrand seeks influence over. Depending on whether the cultist @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-empire-ruins.actors.Z9wyqpwFr4jnPHTP]{Yann Zuntermein} was exposed or not he may be aware of the influence of the Purple Hand in his downfall. If so, he may want agents to investigate the cult’s manipulations in the northerly provinces.</p><p>If he is not aware of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-empire-ruins.actors.Z9wyqpwFr4jnPHTP]{Zuntermein’s} schemes Immanuel-Ferrand may still be convinced that the Jungfreuds of Ubersreik are up to something, and sponsor spying missions, or even acts of sabotage, against them. This is likely to find its way back to him unless the Characters are very good at their jobs.</p><h4>The Holzkrugs</h4><p>Graf @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-empire-ruins.actors.BcGALPPubww6hPnQ]{Liepmund Holzkrug} has done more than any other to bring about the humiliation of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.1Fw8roY9zezj0jAn]{Immanuel-Ferrand}. The Holzkrug dynasty is a celebrated noble line. They have held estates in the Reikland since 1650 IC, and sporadic private wars occasionally broke out between the Holzkrugs and their neighbours in the Barony of Holswig. In 2185 IC Lothar Holzkrug was crowned the Emperor in Altdorf, though at the time there was widespread scepticism towards the electoral system and the Holzkrug dynasty was short-lived and barely acknowledged as legitimate.</p><p>In terms of his impact and influence @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-empire-ruins.actors.BcGALPPubww6hPnQ]{Liepmund} is often compared to @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.1Fw8roY9zezj0jAn]{Immanuel-Ferrand}. As a spy he runs the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.W4LFOIduFZoqSNsN.JournalEntryPage.e1vvDKWEn2EYw0gZ]{Black Chamber}, of which the Graukappen is a department (therefore Immanuel-Ferrand is his subordinate), as a politician Liepmund sits on the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.sVFygKRicWFw6BsT#reikland-council]{Reikland Council} (therefore Immanuel-Ferrand is his superior).</p><p>There has been increasing discord between the two men of late. @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-empire-ruins.actors.BcGALPPubww6hPnQ]{Liepmund} decries the recent takeover of Ubersreik as a rash act, knowing full well that @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.1Fw8roY9zezj0jAn]{Immanuel-Ferrand} encouraged it. Liepmund also planted the evidence that convinced Immanuel-Ferrand that the Jungfreuds were preparing to wage war. Since the turmoil Liepmund has cut the caper and is currently on his best behaviour. However, if agents of Immanuel-Ferrand start snooping into his affairs, he might try to get rid of them or, even worse, start leaving a new trail of misleading evidence.</p><h4>The Witchtaker</h4><p>Count Siegfried von Walfen has many things in common with @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.1Fw8roY9zezj0jAn]{Immanuel-Ferrand}. He is also a relative of the Emperor and has made some inroads of his own into the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.W4LFOIduFZoqSNsN.JournalEntryPage.e1vvDKWEn2EYw0gZ]{Black Chamber}. His charge is to watch for conspiracies and threats from the Electors, and his impressive record has earned him the unflattering nickname of ‘Witchtaker’.</p><p>Siegfried is being groomed to replace @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.1Fw8roY9zezj0jAn]{Immanuel-Ferrand}. He is himself unaware of this, for his own benefactor works so secretly that Siegfried would have no idea who he is. Yet there is someone ensuring that Siegfried, who is by no means incompetent, succeeds in all he puts his hand to.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.1Fw8roY9zezj0jAn]{Immanuel-Ferrand} does not realise Siegfried is being positioned to usurp him, as far as he is concerned the man is a distant relation and a fine spy, but as time goes on Siegfried will be seen to prosper where Immanuel-Ferrand falters, and to be feted by those who voice concerns about the performance of the current High Chancellor.</p><h4>Own Worst Enemy</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.1Fw8roY9zezj0jAn]{Immanuel-Ferrand} is normally a careful diplomat, but he is myopic in his belief that the Empire would benefit if power were centralised. It is a stubbornly held belief and one that will lead the High Chancellor into trouble again if he doesn’t face up to it. The Characters might well secure a brighter future for their patron if they can talk him round to realising that the Empire works best as a flexible confederation, but he won’t give up his ambitions lightly.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"The Lore of Shadows","type":"text","_id":"a68AllavjryjAKv6","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"journal-image float-left\"><img style=\"margin-right:5px\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/ulgu.webp\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" /></div>\n<p>Spells cast from the Lore of Shadows are surreptitious and sly; the <em>lingua praestantia</em> may be muttered stealthily.

Many Grey Wizards work at noble courts, in mercantile houses, or in criminal organisations — although often in a different profession, keeping their identity as a wizard hidden.

Those who are not engaged in cloak and dagger plots prefer to travel throughout the Empire, and even across its borders. Doing so permits them to learn about the state of the Empire and assess the dangers that threaten it from within. Grey Guardians travelling the Empire often arrange to meet their colleagues at particular places at certain days of the year. Sometimes it’s just an encounter between two travellers, other times a group of shadowmancers gather for a few days at an inn or out in the fields. During these encounters and gatherings the wizards share information they’ve learned, and in doing so, get a more complete image of whatever threats exist.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image

Some of them occur naturally, a course of a particular wind that flows over land or sea. Others are planned, such as the network of waystones devised by the Elves to funnel magic towards the Great Vortex.</p><p>The original leylines were fractures in the very fabric of reality, used by the Old Ones as conduits for magic. New leylines were later created by Elves, Dwarfs, and Slann to channel excess raw magic. Magic spirals gradually along leylines to the Vortex.

Natural leylines occur along rivers, mountain ranges, and other terrain features where the Winds of Magic are drawn by sympathetic attraction. These pockets of magical saturation are channelled either through the mysterious Worldroots or a grid of earth energy called the Geomantic Web to form leylines. Natural leylines contain raw magic, but often develop dominant strands according to the geography.</p><p>Planned leylines were created to channel large amounts of aethyric magic. They rely upon waystones and stone circles to move magic toward the Vortex. Planned leylines often cross natural leylines and may draw magic away from them. The oldest planned leylines carry a single colour of magic and are vulnerable to sudden surges, whereas those created by Elves and Dwarfs are designed for maximum stability and equilibrium.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Spellcasting Rules</strong>: Spellcasters who cast spells in the vicinity of a leyline receive a bonus of +1 SL to their Casting Test.</p></li><li><p><strong>Environmental Rules</strong>: Environmental effects depend on whether a leyline is Natural or Planned.

Corrupted or dead branches of the Worldroot network have become arcane pathways for Beastmen and Chaos Daemons alike.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Waystone Properties</h3><p>The mineral composition of waystones, along with their runic marks or inlaid power stones, can manipulate the Winds of Magic in various ways. Waystone properties can be applied to the entire stone or just one of its facings. Multiple properties can be applied to a single waystone, thus allowing each facing to be imbued with a different property.</p><h4>Attraction</h4><p>The most common waystone property is Attraction. Lines of waystones with the attraction property make up the vast network that funnels magic to the @UUID[JournalEntry.BBMts94CJGZ3wRMi.JournalEntryPage.yLUOK05g65WDiAU1]{Great Vortex}. The first waystone in such a line is known as a Gathering Stone. It absorbs magical energy and passes it to the next waystone, which also absorbs magical energy and passes it to the next, and so on. If the outflowing leyline is disrupted so that an attraction waystone cannot pass the Winds of Magic onjwards, they accumulate and blow around the stone haphazardly.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rules of Attraction:</strong> Each facing can attract one leyline. Stones with multiple convergent leylines are normally treated as @UUID[.1nNoPmPeDS1nwkQL#leyline-junctions]{Leyline Junctions}. If a waystone’s leyline outflow fails to reach the next waystone in the network, it becomes a @UUID[.oH74nHwNltwvZfFw#saturated-junctions]{Saturated Leyline Junction}</p></li></ul><h4>Refraction</h4><p>Refraction separates raw magic into its individual colours. This property is often combined with Attraction to maintain leyline stability, by keeping all eight winds separated. Refraction waystones can also separate one or two colours of magic from the rest and funnel them into individual leylines flowing toward other waystones.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rules of Refraction</strong>: Channelling Tests made for spells from the Lores of Beasts, Death, Fire, Heavens, Metal, Life, Light, and Shadows benefit from +1 SL. For all other Lores, channelling is penalised by –1 SL.</p></li><li><p><strong>Separate Winds</strong>: Where a stone refracts a particular wind or winds in a particular direction, the bonus to Channelling Tests only applies to Lores associated with those winds.</p></li></ul><h4>Dampening</h4><p>Dampening stones absorb excess magic to prevent pooling and corruption. These waystones become saturated over time and require ritual cleansing or replacement. Saturated stones cease working and gradually release their stored magic back into the environment. The Dampening property is often given to capstones laid atop other waystones.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Dampening Rules</strong>: Casting Tests made in the stone’s immediate vicinity are penalised by –2 SL, but Dispelling Tests receive a bonus of +2 SL. Dampening stones prevent Leyline Junctions from becoming Saturated.</p></li></ul><h4>Containment</h4><p>The Containment property controls magical energy by deflecting it back toward its source. These waystones — primarily used by Wood Elves and Truthsayers — are usually arrayed in a series or circle. Containment stones can either preserve earthbound magic for casting, or block the spread of corruption from Warpstone, Dhar, or Daemonic entities.</p><p><strong>Containment Rules</strong>: @UUID[.Ze31kfg0jPiRs9Tk]{Environmental Saturation} and @UUID[.joC1vHA5HSQmUa0E]{Corruption} cannot spread across leylines created by Containment waystones.</p><h4>Amplification</h4><p>Amplification markings increase the magical energy in the vicinity of a waystone. Some stones amplify all the colours of magic; others just an individual strand or two. This property is sometimes combined with Attraction and Refraction to maintain the magical equilibrium of leylines. Amplification stones are also found at ritual sites.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Amplification Rules</strong>: Spellcasters who cast a spell within the vicinity of an Amplification waystone receive +2 SL on Casting Tests. If the stone is not on a functional leyline, @UUID[.Ze31kfg0jPiRs9Tk]{Environmental Saturation} increases by +1 level per year in the waystone’s locality.</p></li></ul><h3>Ogham Circles</h3><p>The ancient Belthani migrated north to waystones infused with <em>Ghyran</em>. The priests of the Belthani believed these waystones were sacred to Ishernos, the god-and-goddess of nature and the seasons, and the nature spirits that were found living near them. Triskeles and other symbols were carved into the sacred markers, called ‘Ogham stones’. Altered waystones over time developed divine properties in addition to their original intended purposes. The few remaining hedge witches who guard stone circles do not fully understand the leyline network.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Spellcasting Rules</strong>: Spells from the Lore of Life or Lore of Hedgecraft cast within a druidic circle receive +1 SL on Casting Tests and Channelling Tests. This bonus is cumulative with other bonuses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Waystone Property</strong>: Alternatively an ogham stone may be given a single waystone property. Ogham circles with the Containment property are often set up around a source of corruption.</p></li></ul><h2>Example Leylines</h2><p>The diagram above illustrates some of the properties of leylines and waystones. Note that this diagram is not to scale (waystones may be set miles apart and still perform their functions) and is not representative of any particular place.</p><p><strong>1 – A Natural Leyline</strong>: Magical energy courses along the leyline and permeates into the surrounding environment. The leyline funnels particular magical energies (as decided by the GM). Spellcasters in the vicinity of the leyline may benefit from bonuses to Casting and Channelling, particularly when near the junction toward the top of the leyline. If it wasn’t for planned leylines in the area, this natural leyline would begin to produce @UUID[.Ze31kfg0jPiRs9Tk]{Environmental Saturation}.</p><p><strong>2 – A Planned Leyline</strong>: This is a series of waystones that attract and channel energy toward the Great Vortex. These waystones have the Attraction property. Other planned leylines join with this one, creating two junctions. Spellcasters near the junctions may receive bonuses to casting and channelling. These leylines may form @UUID[JournalEntry.BBMts94CJGZ3wRMi.JournalEntryPage.1nNoPmPeDS1nwkQL]{Nexuses of Power}, and produce @UUID[.Ze31kfg0jPiRs9Tk]{Environmental saturation}, though waystones at the junction often have the Dampening Property to mitigate this.</p><p><strong>3 – A Planned Leyline Crossing a Natural Leyline</strong>: This series of waystones also attracts magical energy but it crosses the natural leyline (1). There are waystones with the Dampening property placed where the planned and natural leylines cross. These mitigate the natural leyline’s energies, making Casting and Channelling Tests harder, and they prevent this section of the natural leyline from producing environmental saturation.</p><p><strong>4 – A Refracted Planned Leyline with Amplifying Waystones</strong>: A Celestial Wizard has set up waystones with the Refract property to direct <em>Azyr</em> from a planned leyline (2) toward their observatory. They have also placed waystones with the Amplify property along the refracted branch to empower Celestial spells. Spells that use the Wind of <em>Azyr</em> will benefit from a bonus near this line, particularly in the area close to the Amplify waystone. However, the area will slowly become saturated with <em>Azyr</em> unless this magical energy is put to some use.</p><p><strong>5 – A Corrupted Planned Leyline</strong>: This leyline was originally intended to attract energy and pass it along to the @UUID[JournalEntry.BBMts94CJGZ3wRMi.JournalEntryPage.yLUOK05g65WDiAU1]{Great Vortex}. However, a Beastman Shaman has corrupted one of the waystones, making it into a herdstone. This profane artefact disrupts the flow of colour magic. The energies that would have been passed to the waystone from the previous uncorrupted waystone have nowhere to go and begin to saturate the environment with stale magical energy, forming a <em>Dhar</em> Pool.</p><p><strong>6 – An Ogham Stone Circle</strong>: This circle has been set up around a large Warpstone meteor, which would normally cause an area of Corrupted Environmental Saturation. The stones exert the Containment effect, meaning that energies from the meteor do not cross the circle. The area within the circle is still influenced by Corrupted Environmental Saturation.</p><h3>Implications</h3><p>This area is largely protected from Environmental Saturation. Despite the presence of a natural leyline, planned leylines in the area will drain saturation as fast as it builds up. Azyr may build up around the celestial observatory and saturation may build up near junctions unless dampening stones are erected to compensate. <em>Dhar</em> will collect around the waystone that has an outflow blocked by the herdstone (which may well be a corrupting influence in its own right). The corrupting influence caused by the Warpstone meteor is confined to the area within the circle of containment stones.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/images/leylines.webp\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":600000,"name":"The Great Vortex","type":"text","_id":"yLUOK05g65WDiAU1","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Though anyone with Second Sight can perceive the Winds of Magic flowing in the direction of Ulthuan, few are aware of the Vortex.

Corrupted leylines (called ‘<em>Dhar</em> leylines’) are both causes and consequences of corruption at leyline junctions. <em>Dhar</em> leylines carry all eight colours in an unstable flow of raw magic. At various points along the leyline, magic pools and congeals into <em>Dhar</em> Pools, which necromancers and Chaos sorcerers manipulate for their most powerful and profane rites (see @UUID[.oH74nHwNltwvZfFw#corruption-of-nexuses-and-fulcrums]{Corruption of Nexuses and Fulcrums}).</p><p>Beastmen use desecrated waystones (called ‘herdstones’) as muster points, meeting places, and sites of grisly rituals. The original runes have been obscured by vines and sickly luminescent moss, and defaced with crude markings. Herdstones are decorated with corpses, weapons, and armour, and they are often guarded by a powerful minotaur.</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>Dhar</strong></em> Leylines: Spellcasters using Witchcraft, Dark Magic, or Chaos Magic in the leyline’s immediate vicinity gain +1 on Casting Tests. <em>Dhar</em> leylines count as @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f.JournalEntryPage.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#malignant-influences]{Malignant Influences}.</p></li></ul><p>Each waystone property causes a different problem when corrupted:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Attraction</strong>: Failure of an outflowing leyline results in magic pooling around the waystone and forming a <em>Dhar</em> Pool within a week (see @UUID[.oH74nHwNltwvZfFw#corruption-of-nexuses-and-fulcrums]{Corruption of Nexuses and Fulcrums}).</p></li><li><p><strong>Refraction</strong>: Damaged stones may cause the colours of magic to mix, creating a <em>Dhar</em> leyline within a day.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dampening</strong>: Occasionally, magic saturates a stone and it becomes a vessel of <em>Dhar</em>, counting as a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f.JournalEntryPage.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#malignant-influences]{Malignant Influence}.</p></li><li><p><strong>Containment</strong>: Degeneration of stones can lead to localised breaches and leakages (see @UUID[.joC1vHA5HSQmUa0E]{Environmental Corruption},).</p></li><li><p><strong>Amplification</strong>: These stones double the rate of magic at saturated junctions becoming a <em>Dhar</em> Pool (4 days instead of a week).</p></li></ul><p>Leylines are usually repaired by cleaning or restoring damaged waystones.

Leyline junctions usually occur at stone circles or single waystones but can also be found at grid-points on the Geomantic Web. Major nexuses of power are found in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf}, the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.journals.Qz6noKBmpHuoVvlU]{Laurelorn forest}, and Albion. Hundreds of lesser nexus points are scattered across the Empire. Nexuses of power are usually stable because magic flows continually through them to the Vortex.</p><h3>Leyline Junctions</h3><p>Leyline junctions include anywhere between two to four leyline ‘inflows’ and one leyline ‘outflow’. A junction outflow combines magic from the inflows into a larger leyline, which in turn leads to another junction many miles away. Junctions are often circles of waystones that combine multiple properties. The concentrated magic flowing through a leyline junction can be tapped to enhance spells and rituals, or to create gems of solidified magic called @UUID[JournalEntry.x6OdswRIafU9qGYs.JournalEntryPage.FZRfLKxw9PKppUR2]{Power Stones}.</p><p>Magical saturation occurs when a junction’s outflow is disrupted. College wizards know that saturation can lead to corruption, therefore disrupted outflows warrant urgent action.

Slann mage-priests use it to channel magic, empower their spirit-selves, communicate telepathically, and produce suitable habitats. In Lustria and the Southlands, Slann pyramid-temples are situated at web nexus points. In the Old World, the Geomantic Web is largely unknown because earth energies are invisible even to those with the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent.

The area affected by arcane fulcrums can be miles across, however the fulcrum itself is usually a single terrain feature such as a stone circle, crevasse, or geyser. Fulcrums are sometimes identified by the strange spellcasting platforms built by wizards during Storms of Magic. These platforms can remain intact long after a fulcrum is stabilised.</p>\n<h3>Saturated Junctions</h3>\n<p>Fulcrums resulting from magical saturation usually occur at a disrupted leyline junction. When a junction’s inflows have nowhere to exit, the winds of magic accumulate and eventually turn to <em>Dhar</em> Pools (see @UUID[.oH74nHwNltwvZfFw#corruption-of-nexuses-and-fulcrums]{Corruption of Nexuses and Fulcrums} below). Storms of Magic can also cause leyline saturation by overwhelming a junction’s outflow capacity.

Critical Casting is twice as likely, occurring on successful rolls that end with 0 or doubles. @UUID[.Ze31kfg0jPiRs9Tk]{Environmental Saturation} in the region increases by +1 level per month. If the saturation isn’t cleared within a year, the junction becomes a <em>Dhar</em> Pool.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Warp Rifts</h3>\n<p>Magic leaks into the world at places where the barrier of earth energy is thin. Spellcasting accidents and violent surges of magic within the material realm can open rifts in the fabric of reality. Raw magic flows uncontrolled through these rifts and turns to Dhar if not controlled by waystones.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Spellcasters receive a random Casting Test bonus of +1 SL to +5 SL (1d10/2), rolled every round.

Some portals produce magic of a specific colour; others use runic archways to separate raw magic as it blows through. Magic portals are more stable than Warp rifts, however they can be corrupted by vandalising the artefacts that maintain their integrity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rules</strong>: Magic Portals are treated like Warp Rifts, except they only produce individual colours of magic and they do not count as @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f.JournalEntryPage.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#malignant-influences]{Malignant Influences}.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Corruption of Nexuses and Fulcrums</h3>\n<p>Morrslieb brings storms of foul magic to the world each Hexensnacht and Geheimnisnacht.

Where Paranoth argued the importance of raw experience in understanding magic, Beltran claimed introspection and contemplation provided true insight — and that mundane life merely confused the mind. This may explain why Beltran was so unpopular amongst his peers and preferred to live away from the College in an isolated tower outside @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR.JournalEntryPage.tVSESlQWIl8QjK6y]{Eilhart}.</p><p>Paranoth and Beltran’s disagreements escalated into attacks on one another’s reputation and eventually violence. Duels between magisters were common at this time, so it was not unusual for differing opinions to turn into open battles. The Jade Wizard was an inventive spellcaster, but Beltran was an accomplished prognosticator, able to foresee Paranoth’s attacks and prepare an appropriate counter-spell. The stalemate was broken when Beltran’s unpopularity in the @UUID[JournalEntry.j72t0e5BVIgeOMB4.JournalEntryPage.N8s4rKsTaQ8rRUU3#the-celestial-college]{Celestial College} proved his undoing — Wizard Lord Otto von Heiermat quietly told Paranoth of several blind spots in Beltran’s foresight.</p><p>The monument outside @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR.JournalEntryPage.tVSESlQWIl8QjK6y]{Eilhart} is the result of Paranoth’s final victory. After walking on foot from @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.V6tkgQ9A2skppjyl]{Altdorf} to Eilhart, the Jade Wizard cast Paranoth’s Hastened Sprouting for the first and last time. Beltran was caught in his tower as vegetation tore into the stonework, erupted through the floors and engulfed the whole structure. The astromancer was killed and the academic dispute resolved, so Paranoth left for the distant east. Lord von Heiermat covered up Beltran’s fate — he is now a half-forgotten footnote in the College’s history.</p><p>Should an intrepid party climb to the top of Paranoth’s Column they will find a pool filled with rainwater. If they descend into the depths, they will find the drowned remains of Beltran’s tower, including his preserved grimoires, a weed-covered orrery with a real warpstone Morrslieb, and the astromancer’s skeleton, pierced by the sharp branches that took his life.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/hook.webp\" width=\"73\" height=\"46\" /></div><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\"><em>Suggestive Scribblings</em></h3><p><em>Beltran the Perspicacious was fascinated by the influence of the planet Deiamol on storms.

Here the sun rarely pierces the thick, unnerving mist covering the area. The ground is a grasping quagmire, home to strange and dangerous creatures. Few ever travel here for there is no reason to do so, except to search for the legendary Stones of Barbaneagra. The road to the Shadow Moor is dangerous, although the route is marked with the @UUID[JournalEntry.7xFrgrOyYX4SVrBL.JournalEntryPage.UR1b5ABtNQjNUbUi]{Grey Order’s} secret signs.</p>\n<p>At the centre of the Shadow Moor is the Shadow Maze. The maze consists of insubstantial walls of mist that shift and move. The mist is a manifestation of Ulgu, the Grey Wind, crafted into the maze over the years by Grey Guardians. Those that can perceive Ulgu clearly are able to safely follow the path towards the centre of the maze, although they can still be directed towards hazards including sinkholes, explosive or choking gas, poisonous moulds, or dangerous creatures. Those unable to clearly perceive the winds stumble blindly into these dangers.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/spot-ulgu.webp\" width=\"338\" height=\"107\" /></div>\n<h3>The Stones of Barbaneagra</h3>\n<p>At the centre of the maze is a wide mound, upon which stand the ancient Stones of Barbaneagra. These six standing stones, one of which has fallen and been partially submerged, are believed to predate Sigmar. Their surfaces are smooth, a dark lichen covering the foot of each. Ulgu clings to each stone, with the mist appearing to slowly be absorbed from within.</p>\n<p>When the pale light of the moons cloaks the stones, symbols appear on each. Each stone is covered in these writings, but they are only ever partially revealed depending on the path of the moons. The text, an archaic form of Elthárin, has different meanings at different times, especially under the light of Morrsleib.</p>\n<p>On the edges of the mound lies a small camp inhabited by members of the @UUID[JournalEntry.7xFrgrOyYX4SVrBL.JournalEntryPage.UR1b5ABtNQjNUbUi]{Grey Order}. The numbers are variable but there are usually two Grey Guardians, usually dedicated scholars, and assorted guards, scribes, and servants. The camp is well established, ringed by a small stockade.</p>\n<p>Life in the camp is a miserable experience for most, who soon become fed up with dried food, little sunlight, and a well-deserved fear of the moor. Some disappear during their time here, attacked by waiting creatures, lost in the mist, or driven by despondency to try and make their way out.</p>\n<p>Magister Alard Bredermann, however, has lived here for over six years. He rarely notices or empathises with the hardships of his companions, dedicating his life to translating the text on the stones. He is certain that their meaning is important and is determined to solve the puzzle. Part of his reason for remaining is that he is afraid to return to Altdorf and admit that he has learned little of import. He has become a bully to those junior to him, especially when he suspects them of making their own breakthroughs.</p>\n<p>Grey Guardians can be assigned to travel to the stones to study or to escort others there. Those from outside of the order must swear oaths to keep secret what they have found. The Grey Wizards are known to test these oaths, and gossips tend to disappear.</p>\n<h3>Mysteries of the Stones</h3>\n<p>Stories of the Stones of Barbaneagra, most famously <em>The Ballad of Kalden the One-Eyed Trapper</em>, often mention a great treasure left there by the gods. Interestingly, @UUID[JournalEntry.7xFrgrOyYX4SVrBL.JournalEntryPage.UR1b5ABtNQjNUbUi]{Grey Order} scholars have noted that the ballad and others like it mention that the stones lie at the centre of a great maze. However, these were written centuries before the maze was created. The Characters may be tasked with finding evidence of the location of the Stones, whether by treasure hunters or other colleges who have heard rumour of the Grey Order’s interest in the stones. They may also be paid to escort treasure hunters or scholars into the moors for what is likely to be unsuccessful ventures. Characters from the Grey Order may be sent to find out why magisters working at the Stones have not returned home, finding one of their own has murdered his companions after believing they have discovered the truth of the message in the stones.</p>\n<p><strong>Effects</strong>: When working with spells from the @UUID[JournalEntry.7xFrgrOyYX4SVrBL.JournalEntryPage.a68AllavjryjAKv6]{Lore of Shadows} a wizard benefits from +2 SL to Casting and Channelling Tests in the vicinity of the Shadow Maze.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":1300000,"name":"The High Lodge","type":"text","_id":"0HJwkohyEqhw7ZM8","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The High Lodge is located in the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains} at the tip of the Drakwald Forest. Access to the mountainside lodge is from a number of narrow paths leading to the statues of a wolf and a bear that mark the entrance to the lodge. Shamans of the Amber Order watch the paths with keen eyes and look to discourage idle guests.</p>\n<p>The lodge is little more than a stone ledge, allowing access to a handful of small rooms cut into the mountainside.

When the fire is lit many visitors experience the trees moving and a feeling of being in the forest. Each night the resident shaman, the Lodge Kin, and visitors tell a range of stories or sing songs, often containing subtle teachings of the use of <em>Ghur</em>. It is at these times the Amber Wind is felt most strongly.</p>\n<p>Most visitors to the lodge are shamans of the Amber Order but others are welcome. The Lodge Kin have no official leader, but most look to Magister Anita Gunderson, the oldest of the group. She is a powerful shaman, but willing to freely share her knowledge.</p>\n<p>Gunderson and the other members of the group have a strong aversion to urban locations, and this can unbalance their views on a variety of topics. Visiting magisters have sometimes felt that the Lodge Kin have been unable, or unwilling, to treat important issues related to towns and cities seriously due to this prejudice.</p>\n<p>Visitors from outside of the Amber Order are welcomed to the lodge if they show the appropriate respect. They are expected to help in chores and support themselves during their visit. The Kin may also take some time to answer any questions while they gauge the motives of the visitor.</p>\n<p>Apprentices are often sent to the Lodge for short periods to study. They find their days are often spent helping with research, assisting visitors, or even carrying wood up the mountain for the fire.</p>\n<h3>The Binding</h3>\n<p>Above the lodge, and hidden from sight, is a small cave. Inside, ancient cave drawings of beasts and magisters are drawn in red ink on the walls. A faint smell of the forest can be detected. Here the Wind of <em>Ghur</em> is strongest, with the kin drawing on its power to perform their most sacred duty — the Binding.</p>\n<p>Celebrants are brought into the chamber in the early hours of the morning. There the Lodge Kin channel <em>Ghur</em> into their bodies, painfully changing their form into those of animals. Bears, wolves, and boars are common. Often the change is complete but other times it is a partial change. The creature is then set free into the forest to roam and live. Once Ghur has seeped from them and their bodies twisted back into their natural form, they make their way back to the lodge, their minds and bodies more closely linked to <em>Ghur</em>. A few do not return, the bodies forever changed or killed by hunters.</p>\n<p>Shaman Characters may need to visit the High Lodge to progress their knowledge and status, or even take part in the Binding. Other Characters may search for the lodge to obtain information from the shamans or track down others that have temporarily made their home there.

The other magisters could not convince the patriarch that the plans were too risky and he was sent to the Cairnapan Complex to use its power to develop his spell. Vottinger was successful using the power of Ghyran to summon gnarled, fibrous hands to emerge from beneath the ground, dragging foes to a claustrophobic, suffocating end. He called the spell <em>Roots of Wrath</em>. He returned in triumph to Altdorf and was greatly rewarded.</p><p>However, the spell had broken barriers to other realms.

That would seem to be the end of damage wrought by Vottinger’s work, but his development of the spell and the power of <em>Ghyran</em> in the Cairnapan Complex had allowed the power summoned by the spell to enter the Old World.

If the range is ‘touch’, the caster must be able to touch the target, or use an Enchanted Staff to do so.</em></p><p><em><strong>Target</strong>: This describes what can be targeted by the spell. Often this will be 1 or more individuals. Spells marked AoE (Area of Effect) affect all individuals within that diameter. If the target is noted as ‘special’ this will be clarified in the description. Spells with a target of ‘special’ cannot use Overcasting to affect additional targets.</em></p><p><em><strong>Duration</strong>: How long the effect lasts. Instant means the spell occurs instantaneously then is finished. Duration expressed as related to a Characteristic Bonus Rounds/minutes/hours etc means a number of that unit of time equal to the Characteristic Bonus of the Caster.</em></p><p><em><strong>Description</strong>: The effect of the spell is described here.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Casting Test</h3><p>Characters can cast spells they have memorised or those they can read from a grimoire.</p><p>To cast a spell a Character must make a <strong>Language (Magick)</strong> Test. This is the Casting Test.</p><p>If the Casting Test is successful, calculate the SL and compare it to the CN of the spell. If the SL are equal to or greater than the CN, the spellcaster casts the spell as explained in the spell description. If not, the spell fails.</p><p>Critical Casting</p><p>If a spellcaster rolls doubles on a successful Casting Test, they cause a Critical Casting. Characters must roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table} unless they have the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.BYChSVfMG004eflQ]{Instinctive Diction} Talent. Characters who Critically Cast may also choose one of three extra effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Critical Cast</strong>: If the spell causes Damage, it also inflicts a Critical Wound.</p></li><li><p><strong>Total Power</strong>: The spell is cast even if the spellcaster did not achieve enough SLs for the Casting Number. The spell can be dispelled as normal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unstoppable Force</strong>: The spell is cast if the spellcaster achieved enough SLs and it cannot be dispelled.</p></li></ul><h4>Fumbled Casting</h4><p>If the spellcaster rolls doubles on a failed Casting Test, they Fumble the cast. They must roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table}.</p><h3>Duration</h3><p>A successfully cast spell remains in effect for its Duration. The only way to end a spell before the Duration has elapsed is to dispel it.</p><h3>Magic Missiles</h3><p><em>Magic missiles</em> are damage-causing spells. When a <em>magic missile</em> is successfully cast, reverse the dice rolled on the Casting Test and refer to the @Table[hitloc]{Hit Locations Table} to see where the target is struck. To calculate Damage, add the caster’s Willpower Bonus to the spell’s listed Damage. This Damage is reduced by the target’s Toughness and Armour Points as usual.</p><h3>Random Vortices</h3><p>Certain spells are called random <em>vortex spells</em> in their descriptions. These spells typically summon a destructive maelstrom of magical energy which moves out of the caster’s control as soon as it is unleashed. <em>Random vortex</em> spells are usually very dangerous spells because they may teeter towards the caster or their allies. When they work as intended, they can wash over multiple enemies.</p><p>Spells using the <em>random vortex</em> rules have effects that remain in play and move randomly every round. These spells are easy to track if using maps and gaming pieces. If not, the GM can either roll and describe the vortex’s movement in detail or narrate its destructive path abstractly.</p><p><em>Random vortex</em> spells use the following procedure:</p><ol><li><p>If the caster succeeds on their Casting Test, they summon a vortex. The Area of Effect occurs adjacent to, but not touching, the caster. The caster then chooses a direction and makes an <strong>Average (+20) Willpower</strong> Test to determine the initial trajectory.</p></li><li><p>If the Test succeeds, the Area of Effect immediately moves [[/r 2d10]] yards directly away from the caster in the chosen direction. If the caster fails the Willpower Test, the vortex immediately moves in a random direction. In either case, everything in its path is affected (possibly including the caster).</p></li><li><p>On every subsequent round, at the end of the caster’s turn, the vortex moves [[/r 2d10]] yards in a random direction, affecting everything in its path. There are two sets of results below, one for where the GM has a detailed depiction of where people stand in relation to one another, and a second for more abstracted movement. Rolling a 1 on the random direction die results in the vortex disappearing prematurely, otherwise it continues moving randomly for the spell’s duration.</p></li></ol><table style=\"width:100%;height:187px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Roll</strong></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">@UUID[RollTable.ZVwNSlXmg9KllolZ]{Vortex Movement Table - Map Based}</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">@UUID[RollTable.QDQjS2y6csQo17bX]{Vortex Movement Table - Abstract}</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">1</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Vortex disappears</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Vortex disappears</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">North</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Caster chooses direction</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">3</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Northeast</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Caster chooses direction</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">4</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">East</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Caster chooses direction</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">5</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Vortex remains in place</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Caster chooses direction</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">6</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Southeast</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Vortex remains in place</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">7</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">South</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">GM chooses direction</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">8</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Southwest</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">GM chooses direction</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">9</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">West</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">GM chooses direction</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">10</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Northwest</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">GM chooses direction</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Touch Spells in Combat</h3><p>Certain spells require you to touch the target. To touch a Character who does not wish to be touched, or who is in combat, the spellcaster must make an <strong>Opposed Melee (Brawling)</strong> Test (generally opposed by the Melee or Dodge Skill) after making a successful Casting Test. If the spell is a <em>magic missile</em>, the Melee (Brawling) Test is reversed to determine the Hit Location struck.</p><p>Some magic items, such as Enchanted Staffs, allow a spellcaster to benefit from their reach when casting touch spells. In this case replace the <strong>Opposed Melee (Brawling)</strong> Test with the most appropriate Melee Test — such as Melee (Polearm) in the case of an Enchanted Staff. This test is made purely to see if the spellcaster touches the target with the item. It is not an attack that would inflict Damage in addition to the effects of the spell.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><p>An ingredient may be used during spellcasting to reduce the risk of Miscasts. If a spellcaster uses an ingredient while casting, they can do one of the following:</p><ul><li><p>A Major Miscast may be reduced to a Minor one.</p></li><li><p>A Minor Miscast may be reduced to no effect.</p></li></ul><p>Ingredients must be bought for a specific spell and cost the CN in silver shillings.</p><h3>Spellcasting Limitations</h3><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/spot-witchcraft.webp\" width=\"230\" height=\"234\" /></div><p>A spellcaster must speak or sing to cast spells. If a spellcaster’s voice is inhibited, the GM should increase the Difficulty of Casting Tests by one step. Generally, the higher the CN of a spell the louder the spell is chanted.</p><p>If a spellcaster casts a spell it must end, or be dispelled, before they can cast the same spell again.</p><p>When spells provide bonuses or impose penalties, the best bonus and worst penalty is applied from all spells cast on a target. They do not stack.</p><p>Unless otherwise stated, a spellcaster must have Line of Sight to their target.</p><h3>Advantage and Magic</h3><p>Advantage applies to Casting Tests but not Channelling Tests. If a target already had a spell from the same Lore cast on it that Round, a spellcaster gains +1 Advantage when casting spells that target that creature or include it in a spell’s area of effect.</p><h3>Channelling Test</h3><p>Characters can gather the power needed to cast powerful spells by Channelling. To channel magic a Character must decide which wind they wish to Channel, and use their action to make an Extended Channelling Test. Each SL adds to a special pool of power, which the Character may use to reduce the CN of any spell they are capable of casting using the Wind they have Channelled.</p><p>Each SL generated in this way reduces the CN of a spell by one, to a minimum of 0. Once the Character feels they have gathered enough power, they must make a Casting Test on their turn, casting the spell at the reduced CN. Any additional power is lost once a spell is cast.</p><p>If the Casting Test fails, the stored energy is lost and the spellcaster must roll on the Minor Miscast Table.</p><p>Channelled power may not be used to Overcast a spell, though of course reducing a spells CN sufficently will make Overcasting more likely.</p><p>If a Character wishes to interrupt their Channelling to do something else — other than casting a spell using their gathered power — they may do so, but this counts as an @UUID[.JcEoePfWMZkaFnJX#interruptions]{Interruption}.</p><p>If, at the start of their turn, a spellcaster wants to stop channelling they may take an action to safely vent their gathered power.</p><h4>Critical Channelling</h4><p>If a spellcaster rolls a double whilst Channelling, they may immediately add a number of bonus SL to the Extended Channelling Test equal to their Willpower Bonus. However, unless they possess the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.1IZWRr7BYOIcqPlQ]{Aethyric Attunement} Talent, they must also roll on the Minor Miscast Table.</p><h4>Fumbled Channelling</h4><p>If the spellcaster fails a Test and rolls doubles during the Extended Channelling Test to cast a spell, they Fumble and must roll on the Minor Miscast Table.</p><h4>Interruptions</h4><p>If a spellcaster is distracted by anything whilst channelling, such as receiving damage or taking a Surprised Condition, they must pass a <strong>Hard (–20) Cool</strong> Test. If they fail this Test, any SL generated on the Extended Channelling Test to cast a spell are lost and the spellcaster must roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} Table.</p><h3>Malignant Influences</h3><p>If a Character is in the vicinity of a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.115GzWrmkD4viyy5#corrupting-influences]{Corrupting Influence} and makes a Casting Test or Channelling Test, there is an additional risk. Any failed roll requires the Character to roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} Table. If the roll would already result in a roll on the Minor Miscast Table (such as a Critical Casting Test or Fumbled Channelling Test), they must roll on the @Table[majormis]{Major Miscast Table} instead.</p><p>Spellcasters using Dark Lores do not count as Malignant Influences in regard to their own Casting and Channelling Tests.</p><h4>Warpstone</h4><p>A spellcaster who uses Warpstone doubles any SL they generate on Casting Tests or Channelling Tests. However, Warpstone is a dangerous Corrupting Influence and counts as a @UUID[.JcEoePfWMZkaFnJX#malignant-influences]{Malignant Influence} as explained above.</p><p>Warpstone is a powerful fuel for magical energy, but it is not limitless. Keep track of how many CN of spellcasting a piece of Warpstone can supply before being entirely consumed. 1 gram of warpstone typically supplies 20 CN worth of magical energy.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/spot-breath.webp\" width=\"226\" height=\"147\" /></div><h3>Repelling the Winds</h3><p>Metal and leather armour repel most winds due to containing quantities of Chamon (in the case of metal) or <em>Ghur</em> (in the case of leather). Spellcasters wearing armour suffer –1 SL to all Casting and Channelling Tests for every Armour Point on the location with the most armour. Casters with the <em>Arcane Magic (Metal)</em> Talent may wear metal armour without penalty; those with the <em>Arcane Magic (Beasts)</em> Talent may wear leather armour without penalty. Chaos Sorcerers may wear Chaos Armour with no penalties.</p><p>The GM may also decide that other forms of dress are inappropriate to spellcasters and impose similar penalties if they see fit.</p><h3>Dispelling</h3><p>A spellcaster may attempt to dispel any spells that target them, or a point they can see within Willpower yards. A spellcaster may attempt to dispel a single spell every round.</p><p>The spellcaster attempting the dispel must make an <strong>Opposed Language (Magick)</strong> Test against the spellcaster attempting to cast the spell. If the dispelling spellcaster wins the Opposed Test then the spell is dispelled and has no effect. If the casting spellcaster wins the Opposed Test, use the opposed SL for the Casting Roll.</p><h4>Dispelling Persistent Spells</h4><p>A spellcaster may attempt to dispel a spell with a lasting effect as an Action. They must make an <strong>Extended Language (Magick)</strong> Test. When their SL reaches the CN of the ongoing spell it is dispelled.</p><p>Multiple spellcasters attempting to dispel the same spell make Tests separately. If they cast using the same Lore as each other they may make an Assisted Test instead.</p><p>A spellcaster dispelling their own spell receives a bonus of +1 SL to the Language (Magick) Test.</p><h3>Multiple Arcane Lores</h3><p>An Elf spellcaster may learn a number of Arcane Lores equal to their Willpower Bonus. An Elf Character may not purchase a new Arcane Magic Talent until they have spent at least 20 Advances in the Channelling Skill of, and learning at least 8 spells from, the previous Lore.</p><p>Any spellcaster may learn a single Dark Lore in addition to another Lore.</p><h3>Overcasting</h3><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>The following Overcasting rules can be enabled in the System settings, named <strong>Use Winds of Magic Overcast Rules</strong></p></blockquote><p>If a Casting Roll generates SL beyond those required to cast the spell, the spellcaster can spend the remaining SL on Overcasting. This involves imbuing a spell with greater efficacy, but it is subject to several limitations.</p><ul><li><p>Overcasting can be used to add additional Range, Area of Effect, Duration, or Targets to the initial values listed in the spell. If the spell is a <em>magic missile</em>, Overcasting can also add to the Damage it inflicts.</p></li><li><p>Spells with a Range of ‘You’ only ever target the spellcaster making the Casting Test. Spells with a range of ‘Touch’ may not be extended. Spells with no Duration, or a Duration of ‘Instant’, may not be extended. Spells with no Area of Effect may not have their area increased.</p></li><li><p>Refer to the Overcast Table to see how additional SL may be spent on Overcasting. It is relatively easy to achieve minor boosts, but more pronounced enhancements cost a great deal of magical energy.</p></li><li><p>Effects can be drawn from multiple columns, but each column may only be accessed once per casting. Any remaining SL are lost.</p></li></ul><table style=\"width:100%;height:136px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>SL</strong></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Additional Target</strong></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Extra Damage</strong></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Extra Range</strong></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Extra AoE</strong></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Longer Duration</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">1</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+1 Target</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+1 Damage</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2 × Range</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Listed AoE</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Listed Duration</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+1 Target</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+2 Damage</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2 × Range</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Listed AoE</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2 × Duration</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">3</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+1 Target</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+3 Damage</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2 × Range</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2 × AoE</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2 × Duration</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">5</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+2 Targets</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+4 Damage</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">3 × Range</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2 × AoE</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2 × Duration</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">8</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+2 Targets</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+5 Damage</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">3 × Range</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2 × AoE</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">3 × Duration</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">13</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+2 Targets</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+6 Damage</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">3 × Range</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">2 × AoE</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">3 × Duration</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">21</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+3 Targets</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">+7 Damage</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">4 × Range</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">3 × AoE</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">3 × Duration</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Hengus the Hedge Witch wishes to cast the Dart spell.

Rituals are complex processes, and often a whole grimoire is devoted to explaining the techniques required for a single ritual.</p><p>A spellcaster may cast a ritual from a grimoire if the ritual belongs to a Lore they possess. In order to use a grimoire, the caster needs to keep both hands free in order to flick through the pages. The ritual’s CN is four times what it would be otherwise.</p><h3>Rituals</h3><p>There are a great many rituals. They tend to cover the summoning of powerful entities or beasts, the creation of magical constructs, and the manufacture of magical artefacts.

However, a Necrofex Colossus is a far bigger and more powerful construct, and the background to such monstrosities suggest that for Ingredients the Necromancer must construct a gigantic form from wood and sinew, and inter both living and dead bodies within the structure.

The symbol of the Eighth Lore is the Arrow. The wizards of this order wear brown robes. An Amber Wizard’s clothes are usually those worn in the wilds rather than robes. They tend to be weatherworn and often carry bows and hunting weapons. They are called shamans by some, Brown Wizards by others.</p><p>Amber Wizards are often solitary individuals, preferring the company of wild beasts to that of people. Amber spells give shamans control over beasts and they can assume the powers of wild creatures to attack their enemies, tossing them aside like autumn leaves.</p><p>The Amber College is the only order that keeps no building in Altdorf. Instead, the Masters of the Order inhabit several caves that lie to the south of the city in the Amber Hills. These are rocky and wooded, unsuitable for agriculture. The caves are not easily found, and visitors are not welcomed. Similar sites exist throughout the Empire in the depths of forests or on mountain peaks.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Wild is the Wind</em></h3><p><em>The magical energies of </em>Ghur <em>are those of beasts and wild places inimical to most Humans. It is a sharp wind that is like a claw or tooth. Where it is concentrated it even manifests as cold silver fire. It is a merciless and inhuman form of magic that cares little for civilisation. It resides most strongly in the minds of wild animals, and to learn its ways is to open one’s mind to the raw and savage power of the wild.</em></p><p><em>Ghur does not easily inhabit urban environments. Channelling (Ghur) Tests suffer from –1 SL in towns and –2 SL in cities. </em>Ghur <em>is more easily perceived in the wilds of the Old World.

Channelling (Ghur) Tests benefit from +2 SL in Middenheim. See <strong>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</strong> for more details.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Sign and Spoor of the Amber Order</h3><p>Members of the Amber Order can be easily recognised by their wild appearance. As well as the arrow, the sign of the hunter and woodsman, they wear talismans of teeth, claws, and feathers, and carry small leather pouches of herbs about their necks.</p><p>The arrow is the mark of Taal, god of wild places and the hunt. Therefore, it was naturally chosen as the symbol of the Amber College and the Wind of <em>Ghur</em>. Just as an arrow is straight and unwavering, so are those who bear it as their mark. Amber Wizards are often plainspoken and have little patience for those who would conceal their intentions with cunning speech.</p><p>Amber Wizards are given to direct action. They distrust politicking and diplomatic wrangling. They believe challenges should be confronted directly and with haste — particularly when a foe is being circumspect in their own actions. Amber Wizards believe that to prevaricate is to display weakness — best to stand firm from a position of strength than to forfeit victory through delay.</p><h3>Wild Youth</h3><p>Some youngsters with the gift will simply feel the call of the wild and seek out an Amber Wizard to learn from. Whether they follow rumours and stories or simply travel by hope and instinct, if they are persistent and dedicated enough, they are sure to eventually find a suitable mentor, or get eaten by Beastmen.</p><p>Life as an Amber apprentice is necessarily hard, but an apprentice who thrives among nature or finds solace in the wilderness will soon get used to the lack of civilisation and grow accustomed to the environment. An Amber Wizard lives among nature as comfortably as anyone in a great house. A roast rabbit is the finest meal and a mossy bank is the most comfortable bed.</p><p>Amber Wizards adorn themselves with charms and totems to help them cast spells and channel the magical winds. Animal skulls and other bones, bird feathers, fur and hides, and such like all have an affinity for <em>Ghur</em>. Shamans’ staffs tend to be of wood or bone and hung with many charms and totems. As their career progresses, shamans are perceived to grow in person more like a wild animal. Their teeth become larger and bared, their hair, longer and more unkempt, their entire face becomes increasingly like the shaman’s ideal creature, a bear, eagle, or wolf, and often their personality will match.</p><p>Shamans soon come to disdain the softness of civilised living, they even play this up in the presence of other Humans to impress or frighten them. Amber Wizards, too, have a reputation for not being able to function in civilised society and not being able to act with the usual politeness and etiquette. But again, this is as much a wizard doing what they will, rather than any sort of inability. For all their reputation for ferocity and disinterest in other Humans, those who do become friends with an Amber Wizard usually find them steadfast and hearty allies.</p><h3>Wilderness Vocation</h3><p>As they advance, Amber Wizards do not require anything so formal as a workshop. As fits their nature, shamans make do with natural materials when enhancing and experimenting with their magic. An Amber Wizard’s dwelling could be any naturally occurring shelter, from a tree to a cave. Over the time the wizard inhabits it, the area becomes increasingly infused with <em>Ghur</em>, and increasingly attuned to their magic. The wizards still study and advance their craft the same as wizards of other colleges, except they do it with paraphernalia and in a location that would seem quite alien, and unsophisticated, to other wizards.</p><p>Amber Wizards fight in the Empire’s armies and work for it in other capacities, just the same as any other college. Though they do not accompany the armies on a permanent basis, they turn up to serve, often out of the blue, either through instinct or under the instructions of senior wizards. Despite being off the beaten track, Amber Wizards plainly demonstrate a strategic understanding of the Empire’s situation and show an interest in her fortunes.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/spot-end-ghur.webp\" width=\"326\" height=\"193\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Amber Wind","type":"text","_id":"WfH1GEfuZF1Jpmg0","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><em>Ghur</em> is a cold, savage wind that flows from the wild places and breaks upon the walls of civilisation. It is found most abundantly where people are not. It blows through the wildest locations, accumulates deep within the forest, whips through the high mountains, coalesces in the foulest swamps, and settles upon remote moors. It is attracted to the activities of the great beasts and top predators, even marking their territory, following their migrations, flowing around their eyries and dens, and lingering about their bodies.</p>\n<p>Amber Wizards, or shamans, fetishise beasts, using skulls and bones, fur and feathers, and the like to adorn themselves; these trappings are known to attract <em>Ghur</em>. Those who study the Lore of Beasts are able to gather the Amber Wind from totems of dead creatures as well as from the vivacity of the living. Just as Amber Wizards are attracted to places where the wind pools, so too are wild creatures attracted to shamans and it is common for Amber Wizards to live in proximity with apex predators, and thereby gain power from them.</p>\n<p>The wind is described as amber or brown in colour, and it does not have the same bright metaphorical hues that the other winds seem to. The many colours of amber are subtle variations on a muddy unnameable colour. Where it blows more harshly it approaches yellow and where it is most entrenched it appears as a deep earthy brown. As it is manipulated by a magister, wisps of red and orange flit through the cold browns.</p>\n<p>The symbol of Amber Magic is the arrow. This is the hunter’s tool, the force that brings wild creatures down and stops the enemy in its tracks. It is direct and to the point, straightforward and relentless. Once loosed, it stops for nothing until it reaches its goal. And it brings death. But the arrow must be aimed, its target carefully selected and the object of concentration. Its lesson is thought before action, for the action cannot be stopped.</p>\n<p><em>Ghur</em> is much scarcer within areas of civilisation, especially cities. But in Altdorf it is even rarer. This could be because of the great size of the city, its ancient fortifications, or the emphatic presence of the other colleges. Amber Wizards generally dislike even travelling through Altdorf, but sometimes they must enter the city, and there they find refuge in the @UUID[JournalEntry.Q9sQhbDN8NUHXYdA.JournalEntryPage.MVwOuM2YKhUvA1E1#the-jade-college]{Jade College}. They even have some totemic presence in the college grounds. This is really the only place, save perhaps the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.cDOlXEpTvnuaOJ0P.JournalEntryPage.ulseg2IAlTWy7m3s]{Imperial Zoo}, where Amber Wizards can stay without feeling anxious and trapped.</p>\n<h3>The Amber Brotherhood</h3>\n<p>There is no such place as the Amber College, except perhaps wherever Amber Wizards are meeting at the time. There are a number of locations across the Empire and beyond its borders which have hosted mass meetings of the most esteemed Amber Wizards or are semi-permanent settlements of communities of shamans. These shelters, though they barely earn that name, are usually part of the natural terrain, like dense wooded areas and cave complexes. Sometimes they are partially constructed of wood and hides and other natural materials that easily blend into the surroundings. There is a site in the Amber Hills near Altdorf that the Brotherhood often use for meetings and to perform complex rites.</p>\n<p>The Amber Wind does not blow in cities like it blows even in civilised, agricultural land, but it is especially sparse within the walls of Altdorf. There is a site within the confines of the @UUID[JournalEntry.Q9sQhbDN8NUHXYdA.JournalEntryPage.MVwOuM2YKhUvA1E1#the-jade-college]{Jade College} in Altdorf dedicated to the Amber Brotherhood, it is decorated with carvings of fanciful wild beasts, but it is clear to shamans that it is not designed by one of their own. It is bare stone and lacks the imagination and expression that might be expected of a shaman. It was built in the time of Magnus the Pious to give the Amber Brotherhood somewhere to meet, however, it is rarely used. The tower does contain directions to other gathering places across the Old World, contained in signs intelligible only to Amber Wizards.</p>\n<p>Communication throughout the Amber Brotherhood would seem to be difficult, yet Amber Wizards do keep abreast of current affairs and seem just as informed as anyone about political and civil life in the Empire. Despite being so dispersed and decentralised the Brotherhood does have an efficient means of spreading news and instructions to members of their order. This is simply through Wizards meeting and exchanging news. This might seem like mere gossiping, but it is much more deliberate and focused than that.</p>\n<p>There is little formal hierarchy in the Brotherhood. They have a nominal patriarch, but important decisions tend to be reached by consensus, and the broad political direction of the school is determined by the natural flow of things. The Brotherhood rarely seems troubled by political infighting or internal power struggles; that sort of power rarely interests shamans, and they are quick to recognise, and disdain, it in others.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/spot-daemon.webp\" width=\"275\" height=\"292\" /></div>\n<h3>Relationships</h3>\n<h4>The Jade College</h4>\n<p>The Amber Brotherhood shows little outward sign of interest in the great organs of state, but it functions well enough inside the Empire and necessarily must interact with some of her institutions. Its main ally and sympathiser is the @UUID[JournalEntry.Q9sQhbDN8NUHXYdA.JournalEntryPage.MVwOuM2YKhUvA1E1#the-jade-college]{Jade College}. The two schools, though markedly different in many aspects, are sympathetic to each other’s causes. The Jade College can be relied upon to advance the Amber point of view among the colleges in Altdorf, when, as is often the case, shamans are not present to fight their own corner. There are spaces within the Jade College in Altdorf where Amber Wizards are welcome to stay.</p>\n<h4>The Cult of Taal</h4>\n<p>Many shamans venerate Taal above all the gods, and the Brotherhood works closely with the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon.JournalEntryPage.GqvN0qGNFSBPi9Dr]{Cult of Taal}. As their domains overlap considerably priests and shamans often come into contact. Fortunately for both groups their interests are usually aligned, and they find it easy enough to cooperate. It has been said that the itinerant priests of Taal are indistinguishable from shamans.</p>\n<h4>The Eonir</h4>\n<p>The Amber Brotherhood is one of the few organisations of the Empire with regular and cordial relations with the Wood Elves of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.archives1-scenes.h9ZlLGfW0lZKIG4k]{Laurelorn}. Amber Wizards often visit the forests of the Eonir to exchange news and views. Many shamans are more sympathetic to the known long term aims and strategies of the Eonir than those of the Empire, considering the latter to be short-sighted. Amber Wizards are among the few Humans to be granted genuine respect by the Elves.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Gregor Martak","type":"text","_id":"fWox4v7eQmND1Qit","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/actors/gregor-martak.webp\" width=\"296\" height=\"296\" /></div><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.vErRQ0QEVapPSdkM]{Gregor Martak}</p><p>Martak is gifted, or cursed, with vivid premonitions of the future.

This is not because of any particular interest in politics or power but because he feels an obligation to know his enemy.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.vErRQ0QEVapPSdkM]{Martak} has even less interest in the politics of his Brotherhood but senses with increasing certainty that he will be appointed patriarch sooner or later. He feels this call to power and the responsibility he will bear, even as his instinct is to run from it as fast as he can.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.vErRQ0QEVapPSdkM]{Gregor} is hounded by nightmares and visions. This is where he sees his rise to prominence, and, he suspects, his own death. But worse, in these visions he sees the destruction of the Empire. Martak sees a range of terrible attacks on the Empire, coming from many different sources. Although he senses that many of these events will occur some distance in the future, he is developing a network of allies who are able to travel the Empire, visit the sites of these possible incursions, investigate them, and report back to him. Of course, if the danger is imminent, he will expect them to fight back there and then.</p><h3>Martak as Patron</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.vErRQ0QEVapPSdkM]{Martak} needs people on his side, and he will not be reluctant to send them into danger. If they do not return, it will be a price worth paying. However, he will view these people not as minions to be ordered around, or soldiers to be commanded, but genuine friends and allies in the fight against what is to come. In turn, anyone who Martak grows to trust will be sure to get his full backing. Martak has friends all around the Empire, and so his help could manifest in any number of unexpected sources.</p><h4>Beastmen from Below</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.vErRQ0QEVapPSdkM]{Martak} has had visions of strange, shadowy Beastmen emerging from beneath the cities of the Empire, enslaving its people and toppling its great buildings. In some nightmares he sees the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.cDOlXEpTvnuaOJ0P.JournalEntryPage.TwV8JKaTUnfo3ipT]{Temple of Sigmar in Altdorf}, in others the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-middenheim.journals.PuIrlGBOjxuWpK3P.JournalEntryPage.fvLZwi16FbG2gc7V]{High Temple to Ulric} in Middenheim. He sees many other cities falling, too. Martak is concerned and needs a likely bunch of urban adventurers to investigate. Exactly what lies beneath the cities of the Empire. What sort of Beastman could survive down in the sewers? Do these visions make any sense at all?</p><h4>Made to Measure</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.vErRQ0QEVapPSdkM]{Martak} has seen great armies of Chaos boil out of the Chaos Wastes and attack the Empire, albeit only in his mind. He knows, however, that this is going to happen. He has a clear picture of the terrain the attack will go through, streaming into the Empire across the Ostland border. He needs some scholarly Characters to follow his directions, travel to the border and locate the precise site of the invasion. They will need to survey and map the area in detail for plans he may or may not ever put in place.</p><p>So as not to alarm the locals this will all need to be done in the utmost secrecy. The Characters will need to come up with a good cover story for their behaviour, too, or they will simply look like spies.</p><h4>A Rock and a Hard Place</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.vErRQ0QEVapPSdkM]{Martak} has seen a tall standing stone defiled by Beastmen and its power tapped by Bray Shamans. The stone will be used, he foretells, as a great rallying point for legions of Beastmen before they move across Nordland bringing devastation. Though this is some way in the future, who knows how far? Now would be the time to thwart it.</p><p>If the Characters could travel into the forest, find the stone, pull it down, and shatter it into dust, this would be a great service to the Empire. The problem with the plan is that the stone lies deep within Wood Elf territory, and the Eonir still use it as a site of worship and a source of power.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"The Lore of Beasts","type":"text","_id":"STGUCefMRjHk6OYP","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"journal-image float-left\"><img style=\"margin-right:5px\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/ghur.webp\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" /></div><p>The Amber Wind, Ghur, carries with it a chill, primal ferocity that unnerves beasts and sentient creatures alike.

Since the publication of <strong>WFRP</strong> some players and GMs have wondered about the implications of such magic.</p>\n<p>For the sake of brevity a wizard under the effects of a transformation spell is described as being ‘in Beast Form’. However these principles should apply to any transformation spells or effects.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens to a Character’s trappings when they are transformed?</strong></p>\n<p>When a wizard transforms into a beast they ruin any clothing they are wearing and drop all their trappings at the point the transformation takes place. There are some exceptions, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.3gcQd76dvr5U0vDU]{Enchanted Staffs} made for Amber Wizards, and their magical robes, are suitably infused with Ghur that they transform along with the wizard, and back again when the spell’s duration is reached.</p>\n<p><strong>Is a Character stuck in Beastform until the duration is reached?</strong></p>\n<p>Pretty much. Beast Form effects a Character’s psychology as well as their physical form, and whilst a wizard may still make rational and intelligent decisions in Beast Form, the complexities of dispelling are beyond them.</p>\n<p>However, when a wizard casts Beast Form they can decide to curtail the spell after a shorter period of time has passed than the listed duration. This must be declared at the time the Casting Test is passed. So a Wizard with a Willpower of 56 who does not declare a particular limit will be stuck in Beast Form for 56 minutes, but if they declare that they only want to be in Beast Form for ten minutes at the time of casting they will revert back to their original form after ten minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>If a Critical Injury is inflicted to a wizard whilst they are in Beast Form does it carry over once they return to normal?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"journal-image float-right flip\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/actors/beastform.webp\" width=\"294\" height=\"348\" /></div>\n<p>Yes. Injuries to forelimbs may damage the legs, but the GM should turn them into appropriate damage to arms when the wizard transforms back.</p>\n<p><strong>Are Skills and Talents retained in Beast Form?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, unless specified otherwise in the spell description. Note that opposable thumbs and articulate voice boxes are not, so many skills will be impossible to practically use. The GM should therefore impose significant penalties to Skill Tests bearing your altered form in mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you benefit from Characteristic Advances in Beast Form?</strong></p>\n<p>No. The standard profile of the beast in question becomes your current profile no matter how much you have improved your own Characteristics with Experience. Skill advances may still carry over.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"name":"Shaman","text":{"content":"<blockquote>\n<p> ‘The Amber College is outside the city.’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Shaman riddle</em></p>\n<p>‘Had one of those shamans in the other day. He ended up sleeping in the stable. I was gonna let him stay for free, but he said it was the best room in the Inn. So I charged him the same price as the luxury suite.’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Arnold Fleiss, Innkeeper</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Ruled by your magical affinity you are drawn instinctively to the wild places and its great beasts.</em></p>\n<p>Amber Wizards are known for their feral appearance and lifestyle, more at home in the wilderness than the town, and with more affinity for animals than their fellow Humans. Many wander the Empire’s vast untamed landscape, but just as many find a place they like and settle there. Every village in the Empire has a story of a local monster, giant, or witch who lives in the forest and is to be feared but is seldom encountered. More often than not, this is an Amber Wizard.</p>\n<p>Some wizards do interact and cooperate with the people of nearby villages. Though they are more comfortable on their own and loathe to be disturbed, many are kind enough to help and advise local communities when they need it. The superstitious folk of the Empire, being what they are, often shun the Amber Wizards in return.</p>\n<p>Just as there is little formal hierarchy within the Amber Order, there is no formal system for entering it as an apprentice. Wizards are always on the lookout for potential apprentices, those with a spark of the magical about them and an instinct for the wild. Some wizards even steal babies from the crib, they say. More likely, if a shaman comes across a potential young recruit, they will reach an agreement with their parents to take them on. However feared wizards might be among the folk of the Empire, few parents are not going to feel some sort of pride and accomplishment if their offspring is raised into such lofty ranks.</p>\n<div

doors</span></p><h3>Worshippers</h3><p>Haendryk's cult attracts anyone concerned with trade and coin. Merchants are his primary supplicants, but those who work with gold, such as jewellers, also honour him, while caravan guards pray to him to protect their charges.</p><p>Minting houses, banks, and well-established shops have shrines to Haendryk kept on a shelf. The first coin made each day is considered Haendryk’s, and is placed on the altar in the belief that what is given to the god will be returned twice over.</p><p>It is rare to find followers among the lower classes. Instead, the cult recruits from established merchant families or guilds. Many such families seek positions for their young scions to secure favourable treatment, and the cult accepts anyone for a fee.</p><h3>Holy Sites</h3><h3>Penances</h3><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Strictures</strong></em></h3><ul><li>No day without Profit</li><li>Deal in Truth</li><li>Help those who help themselves</li><li>Always get the best deal</li></ul></blockquote><p><em><strong>No Day Without Profit</strong></em></p><p>A follower of Haendryk must ensure the day is profitable. Coin is preferred, but profit can mean many things depending on the person. The important thing is the worshipper should act for their own net gain, whether this be closing an important trade deal, or getting one’s fellows to buy the next round of drinks. It is understood that the greater a person’s station, the more Haendryk demands of this stricture.</p><p><em><strong>Deal in Truth</strong></em></p><p>The Cult of Haendryk forbids false dealing, as trickery erodes the trust all trade is based upon. Followers cannot obscure the value of their wares, nor sell something they have no right to. </p><p>While they must deal truthfully, this is not the same as dealing honestly. Followers are free to exaggerate benefits, neglect to mention complications, or use information at their disposal to get the upper hand. Lying to gain an advantage would be in violation of this stricture, but using insider knowledge of a competitor’s financial situation would not.</p><p><em><strong>Help Those Who Help Themselves</strong></em></p><p>Haendryk earned his godhood and looks down on anyone not willing to do the same. While Haendryk ’s followers are called to share their earnings to benefit society, it must not be in a way which Haendryk views as encouraging laziness.</p><p>A priest of Haendryk would never give a beggar money for shelter, for example. Instead, they might direct them to a workhouse to earn their keep and contribute to the running of the institution.</p><p>Some in the cult interpret this as a condemnation of taxation, which they view as governments taking money not rightfully theirs. They fulfil this stricture by lobbying political figures to enact tax cuts, allowing them to distribute their money as they see fit.</p><p><em><strong>Always Get the Best Deal</strong></em></p><p>Trading is a holy act, a pure competition of wits with only one victor. Therefore, a follower of Haendryk must always get the best possible deal, regardless of circumstances. If a person is looking to buy grain, they must pay for it. The fact that their village is starving should not warrant merciful treatment.</p><p>However, the best deal does not always mean the most profitable. After all, if you take everything a person has, then who will trade with you next time? Sometimes, the best deal is one which builds relationships and leaves everyone happy, so that more profit can be extracted in the future.</p><h3>Blessings</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.prayers.FElNQGNiPzaOwwKT]{Blessing of Charisma}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.prayers.OkKWAfnMiHfxhTnB]{Blessing of

This chapter shows you how to make your own Character from scratch. Most begin the game as unremarkable inhabitants of the Empire — possibly destined for greatness, but no-one would guess it. That’s not to say you can’t rise from humble origins, just that you’ve got a long journey ahead, and that you’ll probably need a better pair of boots. </p><p>All the information describing your Character’s abilities is recorded on a Character Sheet. We provide ready-made Characters and sheets in the <strong>WFRP Starter Set</strong>, and online at cubicle7.co.uk. Using ready-made Characters is a great way to start playing and find out how the game works, but sooner or later you’ll want to create your own from the ground up.</p><p>When deciding what your Character will be like, discuss the kind of group you want to create with the other players. This makes sure that the group’s Characters complement each other and that together you will have a broad and versatile range of abilities. Your GM may also have a particular kind of game in mind, and you’ll need to make sure you have the right mix of Characters. Perhaps the GM plans for you to join a group of apprentice wizards who know one another at the Colleges of Magic? Maybe you are part of a unit of soldiers who have all deserted? Or maybe you are one of a disparate band of Reiklanders press-ganged into service by a powerful noble? Knowing this is important to help you build a suitable character which will be more fun to play.</p><h3>Creating a Character</h3><p>In some sections, you can either choose an option or accept the result of a dice roll to make the choice for you. You may receive bonus Experience Points (XP) for choosing to accept random outcomes, as if the Dark Gods of Chaos themselves applaud your acceptance of random chance. XP represent learning from experience and are the principal way to improve your abilities — you will be able to spend these points to enhance your character’s abilities. XP are covered in more detail in @UUID[.e5PQEbXYkH14z525]{Career Advancement}. </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"FIIsUxJ6xGvEDRPV":3},"flags":{"core":{}},"title":{"show":false,"level":1},"system":{}},{"name":"1) Species","type":"text","_id":"l0f11ypRjH9sR48Q","image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>Choose one of the five Species</em>.</p>\n<p>Your Character will be a Human, Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, or Wood Elf.

From the plains of the Estalian Kingdoms to the frozen oblasts of Imperial Kislev, Humans occupy every corner of the continent, and they thrive. The largest, most powerful Human realm is the Empire, a patchwork of powerful provinces blanketed in seemingly endless forests. Standing proud at the heart of this Empire, the Reikland is its richest, most cosmopolitan region.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img title src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/witch-hunter.webp\" width=\"345\" height=\"493\" /></div>\n<p>Many Reiklanders see it as their divine right to rule, for the patron god of the Empire, Sigmar, was himself a Reiklander before he ascended to godhood many centuries ago. Temples and shrines to the god are found everywhere, and the majority of Reiklanders are devout believers in Sigmar’s message of Empire and unity. Because of this, they are significantly more friendly, open, and optimistic than other folk, since what could possibly go wrong for a land that birthed a god? By comparison, outsiders often see them as arrogant, over-bearing meddlers who stick their unwanted noses into any affair.</p>\n<p>Beyond their affluent lifestyles and pushy personalities, Reiklanders are largely the same as other Humans. They may be shorter-lived than other species, but Humans possess more vigour, versatility, and ambition. They also have a seemingly inextricable relationship with the insidious horrors of the Ruinous Powers, with more Humans falling to corruption than any other species. Perhaps it’s no surprise the declining elder species grow increasingly concerned the meteoric rise of Humanity could result in cataclysm. </p>\n<h4 class=\"no-toc\">Opinions</h4>\n<p><strong>On Dwarfs…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘They’ve been our allies since Sigmar walked this very city; fought with them meself back in ’05. Sure, they’re a bit stubborn, seriously vindictive and pretty blunt, but I won’t hear a word said against them.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Reikäger Jungling, State Soldier from Altdorf</p>\n<p><strong>On Halflings…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘If I gets meself the sort wot eats and smokes all day, then I’m happy as Ranald in catnip. It’s when I get them without proper manners nicking me crockery or knives and forks: that I just can’t abide! They’re all smiles and shrugs when the watch come to pick ’em up, like they don’t understand what they done wrong.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Stefan Krause, Innkeeper from Stirgau</p>\n<p><strong>On High Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘Yes, I do trade with them. And, no, don’t be ridiculous, I’ve never been turned to a pillar of salt just by looking at them. Truly, I find them graceful and urbane. Proper civilised, I’d say. But, ’tween you and me, if Verena were to ask, I might also say I find them just… odd. So very intense. Like every deal we make really matters.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Dorothea Taalenstein, Merchant from Kemperbad</p>\n<p><strong>On Wood Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘Elves of the forest you say? Ain’t none of ’em around here, mate. You want to be goin’ south to Bretonnia. I hear they gots loads of them, and that they’re completely horrible!’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Siggina Gerster, Bawd from Ubersreik</p>\n<h3>Dwarfs</h3>\n<p>Dwarfs — or ‘Dawi’ as they call themselves — are legendarily gruff and stubborn. While the majority reside in vast mountainside fortresses known as Holds, most larger towns and the capital of the Reikland also have Dwarf populations. Given their clannish nature, they tend to band together, forming enclaves or districts wherever they settle. Many of the Dwarfs living in Reikland are the descendants of those driven from Fallen Holds many centuries ago, but most still consider themselves as Dwarfs of the Grey Mountains, although some have never seen a hill, let alone a mountain.</p>\n<p>Dwarf culture respects skill in crafting — chiefly stonework, smithing and engineering — and Dwarf Holds are resplendent with impressive feats of artifice. They also covet gold and jewels, mining deep beneath the mountains in the pursuit of precious metals and gemstones. However, more than these material possessions, Dwarfs venerate their elders and ancestors, and have entire religions focussing upon important progenitors. Dwarfs cannot cast spells, although their runesmiths carve artefacts with intricate runes to harness magical power. </p>\n<p>However, their prowess as engineers is so impressive that some of their more ingenious clockwork or steam-powered devices are mistaken for magic by simpler folk. </p>\n<p>Dwarfs are squat with thick, muscular limbs and stout, broad torsos. Their features are heavy and their hair is thick. Length of hair is a mark of pride and status amongst Dwarfs, with elaborate braids and adornments demonstrating rank: to shave a Dwarf causes terrible shame. Indeed, honour is a  fundamental aspect of their character. Given their long memories and proud natures, they bear grudges against those who have slighted or dishonoured them, gripping tight to their grievances for many years, even taking on the grudges borne by their ancestors, knowing their forebears will be watching over them, nursing their bitterness long after death. Whilst it might be hard for others to win a Dwarf ’s friendship, once given it is absolute. While not as ageless as the near-immortal Elves, Dwarfs can live for many centuries. Indeed, some say that as long as a Dwarf has a purpose, they will not die unless struck down in battle, such is the strength of their conviction.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img title src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/artisan.webp\" width=\"353\" height=\"446\" /></div>\n<h4 class=\"no-toc\">Opinions</h4>\n<p><strong>On Reiklander Humans…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘Like my father and my father afore me, I’ve been living in Reikland all me life. As folk go, they know not to mess with my business, and show the respect I deserve, as is right. Yes, they’re unreliable, and as changeable as the wind, but they’re also resourceful and shrewd, so I’d recommend them as risky business partners, as they see solutions I’d not even consider.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Garral Herraksson, Jeweller from Eilhart</p>\n<p><strong>On Halflings…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘They’re just not my kind of folk. Always smiling. Always fidgeting. Always talking. Always moving in big groups that just won’t shut up! When they come in my store, I like to shoo them off with a broom. Really, what have they got to be so happy about? I just don’t trust them.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– Helgi Galannasniz, Burgher from Schrabwald</p>\n<p><strong>On High Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘Don’t talk to me about those bloody bastards!

As such, many Dwarfs have the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.psychologies.Q2MCUrG2HppMcvN0]{Animosity (Elves)} Psychology trait. Given some WFRP parties contain both Elves and Dwarfs, this may lead to unhelpful tensions. So, you may prefer to ignore this Talent between party members..</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Halflings</h3>\n<p>Halflings are ubiquitous across the Reikland, found working in service industries in all towns, with an entire district of Reikland’s capital of Altdorf, known as Haffenstadt, packed tight with hundreds of extended Halfling families supporting restaurants, taverns, pipeweed stores, and an enormous number of street-food hawkers. Halflings are also a common sight in many of Reikland’s villages, where it is not uncommon to find them employed to staff an inn or run a farm. They are communal creatures, preferring to live in close-knit family groups, sharing houses, rooms,and even beds with dozens of friends and relatives; everyone contributes and everyone shares. This interdependent lifestyle leaves many Halflings struggling with the concept of private ownership and space.</p>\n<p>Halflings are notoriously interested in recording their lineage, and many Halfling clans can trace their ancestry back many centuries to the very founding of the Mootland (their self-governed Grand Province in the Empire). The Elder of the Moot — currently Hisme Stoutheart — is the custodian of the <em>Haffenlyver</em> , an ancient embroidered scroll detailing the chief bloodlines of their primary clans, said to be the greatest treasure of the Halflings. </p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img title src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/messenger.webp\" width=\"306\" height=\"430\" /></div>\n<p>Another peculiar detail is the Halflings’ strange affinity for Ogres. Despite their ravenous appetites, and penchant for eating whatever is at hand, Ogres tend to respect Halflings. Indeed, gangs of Ogre labourers are often overseen by Halfling gaffers, and most Ogre mercenary bands have a Halfling cook on staff.</p>\n<p>Halflings are short, apple-cheeked and beardless, resembling big-eyed, round-faced (and round bodied) Human children, and their sunny dispositions and curly locks only reinforce this impression. They are known for their enormous appetites in all things and their lack of concern for personal space (they’re huggers), social boundaries (‘Well me’ great aunt’s just shacked up with me best mate, and you should hear what they’ve been up to!’), and property rights (‘It’s not like he’s using it!’); this last has landed more than one Halfling in jail for thievery. </p>\n<h4 class=\"no-toc\">Opinions</h4>\n<p>On Reiklander Humans…</p>\n<p><em>‘Stiff-necked and pious, warlike and jealous… I could go on, but good manners halts me, and, besides, I like them, and they like me pies. As long as you keep away from their temples and the hard-liners, they’re an open and pretty welcoming bunch. Good folk, and good for business.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– ‘Tubs’ Samworth Rumster XVI, Pie-seller from Kalegan</p>\n<p><strong>On Dwarfs…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘My aunt Bessi was the greediest, as were six of her sons. But Bessi has nothing on them Dwarfs. Eyes grow as big as Mannslieb at even a scratch of gold. But, if you tell them that, they’ll growl at you like you’ve taken the last honeycake, and start scribbling notes in one of their damned books about insulting their family honour or whatnot.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– ‘Lilly’ Joseppinalina Hayfoot, Pedlar in the Reikland</p>\n<p><strong>On High Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘I’ve seen them on the rivers in their white ships.

Same as the rest of us, it seems, just more... earnestly.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– ‘Dainty’ Cordelineth Brandysnap IV, Thief from Altdorf</p>\n<p><strong>On Wood Elves…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘Elves living in the woods? Don’t be bloody ridiculous. Elves live in white towers and pretty boats over in Altdorf-town, you idiot.’</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\">– ‘Jammy’ Mercimaus Alderflower II, Scholar from Fielbach</p>\n<h3>High Elves</h3>\n<p>High Elves are a relatively common sight on the rivers of Reikland. Both Altdorf and Nuln boast sizeable districts populated by High Elf merchants who ship goods down the Reik through Marienburg to the sea. These merchants are by far the most numerous of the High Elves found in Reikland, alongside diplomatic entourages and support staff. Aloof, alien, and long-lived, they are a passionate, emotional folk widely perceived in the Reikland to be the most beautiful of the species, and also the most arrogant.</p>\n<p>Tall and slender with delicately pointed ears, most Elves have long, fine hair and melodious voices. Although they might look frail, their physiology is not only surprisingly strong, but also extraordinarily agile and dextrous. There are very few noticeable gender differences between Elves, which often causes confusion among Humans who interact with them. </p>\n<p>The High Elves, who call themselves ‘Asur’, are native to Ulthuan, a magical island lying to the west of the Old World. A proud species, they boast of being amongst the oldest of the world’s civilisations. High Elves show considerable disdain for Dwarfs, with whom they have a long history of conflict. Since their abandonment of the Old World in the aftermath of the War of the Beard, the Asur have been torn apart by civil war, the ‘kinstrife’, although this isn’t something they discuss openly with outsiders. As a result of this millennia-long struggle, Elves from the war-torn north of Ulthuan tend to be hard-bitten, practical, and ruthless. </p>\n<p>High Elven society is tightly-bound by ritual and discipline, intended to keep soaring emotions in check and provide focus for their complicated intellects. Seeming contrary to this, some Asur revel in wild adventure. The term ‘Sea Elf ’ is often used by other species to describe the dauntless High Elves who venture beyond Ulthuan’s safe shores as mariners, traders, and diplomats, and who stand in stark contrast to any grim Asur accompanying them who follow warrior lifestyles.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img title src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/envoy.webp\" width=\"259\" height=\"449\" /></div>\n<h4 class=\"no-toc\">Opinions</h4>\n<p><strong>On Reiklander Humans…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘They are corrupt, jealous, and rapacious in their short-lived hungers.

During the closing stages of the War of the Beard, most Elves retreated from the Old World, but a few remained and withdrew to the depths of the magical forests they now called home. Over three thousand years of isolation, hardship, and warfare then ensued, leaving ‘Wood Elves’ culturally very different to their High Elf cousins. </p>\n<p>Wood Elf life is entwined with nature, with a society intermixed with spirits of the forest. They are separatists who work hard to hide themselves away, with arboreal outposts cunningly concealed with powerful illusions and misleading magics. On the rare occasions they travel beyond their borders, it is usually for war, as often with their neighbours as with darker forces, leaving other peoples of the Old World deeply unsure of the fae, capricious Elves.</p>\n<p>There are two kiths of Wood Elves most commonly seen in Reikland. The ‘Asrai’ from Athel Loren across the Grey Mountains, and ‘Eonir’ of the Laurelorn Forest far to the north in Nordland.</p>\n<p>The ruthless Asrai of Athel Loren are xenophobic and secretive, and rarely venture beyond their borders. However, a decade ago, Naith the Prophetess foresaw the possible death of Athel Loren. In response, the King and Queen of the Wood, recognising the fate of their forests may lay in the hands of outsiders, sent tattooed kinbands out from Athel Loren to take action, hunting the enemies of the forest at the source. </p>\n<p>These ferocious bands are sometimes led by a spellsinger who calls upon the old, magical paths of the Worldroot to transport them between Athel Loren and the depths of other forests long lost to the Elves, but not yet consumed by civilisation or Chaos. Occasionally, these wild hunters perceive some common cause with other Old Worlders and an individual may step from the shadows to join with those fighting a greater evil.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the Queen of the Laurelorn takes a very different path to the foretellings given to her and has recently sent a sizeable delegation to make camp in the deep forest of the Amber Hills just south of Altdorf. These Elves observe Human politics concerning the Laurelorn and beyond, and occasionally intervene on matters deemed important. The camp is viewed as a ‘temporary’ solution by the Elves, but the meaning of that word is very different to the long-lived species. Because of this camp, these Wood Elves are a growing presence in Reikland as they venture from the trees and wander according to their inscrutable purposes, often as hunters or entertainers.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img title src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/hunter.webp\" width=\"348\" height=\"507\" /></div>\n<h4 class=\"no-toc\">Opinions</h4>\n<p><strong>On Reiklander Humans…</strong></p>\n<p><em>‘I see hateful creatures with darkness in their hearts and a complete disrespect for order.

Don’t be deceived by numbers alone, there are many aspects to character generation and all the Species have advantages and disadvantages at each stage, some of them not always obvious.</span></p></blockquote><h3>Characteristics</h3><p>Your ten Characteristics are used in Tests, to determine if you perform an action successfully. The Human average for these Attributes is 30. Those who are gifted, or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60. Of course, other Species have their own strengths and weaknesses, so their averages are different, sometimes significantly so.</p><h4>Determining Characteristics</h4><p>When determining your Characteristics: </p><p><strong>Step 1) </strong>Roll 2d10 for each of the ten Characteristics and make a note of the results. If you feel your Character would be improved if you swapped round some of the dice roll results between Characteristics, move to the next step. If you stick with your random results, add the die rolls to the modifier for each Characteristic from the Attribute Table, write them on your Character Sheet and gain +50 XP. </p><p><strong>Step 2) </strong>Rearrange the ten numbers rolled under step 1, assigning each to a different Characteristic (and adding its modifier). If you’re happy with this new mix, record them on your Character Sheet and gain +25 XP. If not, move to the next step.</p><p><strong>Step 3) </strong>If you’re still not happy with your results, either roll again and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore the dice completely! Instead, allocate 100 points across the 10 Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic. Add the modifiers from the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet. Like rolling again, there is no XP bonus for this option.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em> ATTRIBUTES

effectiveness in the free-for-all of a massed melee. It is also used for unarmed combat, where your body is the weapon!</p><h4>Ballistic Skill (BS)</h4><p>Your effectiveness at hitting with ranged weapons like bows and throwing knives, and for throwing things generally. It is also used as the basis for other ranged attacks like Trolls vomiting.</p><h4>Strength (S)</h4><p>How much damage you do in melee, how much you can lift, and how good you are at things like swimming and climbing.</p><h4>Toughness (T)</h4><p>Your physical hardiness. It helps you survive damage in combat but will also help with things like surviving harsh conditions and standing up to poison.</p><h4>Initiative (I)</h4><p>Speed of thought and reaction, especially in the heat of battle and when under pressure. It determines combat order, and helps you be the first to react to danger. It also determines your powers of intuition and perception.</p><h4>Agility (Ag)</h4><p>Physical coordination and natural athleticism, and the basis for things like running, riding, and hiding. Agility is also used for dodging blows in combat.</p><h4>Dexterity (Dex)</h4><p>Your affinity for performing fine and delicate manual tasks like playing a musical instrument or skilled manufacturing. It will also help you with things like sleight of hand and picking pockets.</p><h4>Intelligence (Int)</h4><p>Your powers of thought, analysis, and understanding. Useful for healing, evaluating, and general knowledge, and vital for the understanding and casting of magical spells.</p><h4>Willpower (WP)</h4><p>General strength of mind, and your ability to shrug off difficulty and plough on with the job in hand. It helps with resisting all sorts of influence and coercion, and guards against fear and terror.</p><h4>Fellowship (Fel)</h4><p>Your ability to get on with people and come across as generally pleasant and acceptable. It will help you when chatting to locals or commanding people in battle, charming the guards or attempting to bribe them, and, for pious characters, communicating with your deity.</p><h4>Characteristic Bonuses</h4><p>The first or ‘tens’ digit of each Characteristic is its bonus value. Characteristic Bonuses are used in a variety of different ways throughout the rules, particularly for limiting Talents and defining Spells. </p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Strength (S) 39 equates to a Strength Bonus of 3. Willpower (WP) of 51 equals a Willpower Bonus of 5</em>.</p><h3>Wounds (W)</h3><p>Your Wounds show how much Damage you can endure based on your physical power and your force of will to shrug off injury. See  Chapter 5: Rules for how Wounds are used to track Damage.</p><h4>Determining Wounds</h4><p>Unlike other Attributes, Wounds are derived from your Strength Bonus, twice your Toughness Bonus,, and Willpower Bonus (abbreviated to SB, TB, and WPB on the Attributes Table). Refer to the Attributes Table to determine the Characteristic Bonuses used to calculate your Wounds. Note: Halflings have the Small Talent automatically and start with fewer Wounds, (see @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size}).</p><h3>Fate &amp; Fortune, Resilience &amp; Resolve</h3><p>Your Fate represents your destiny, and is directly tied to your Fortune, a measure of your luck. Your Resilience is your inner strength, which is directly related to your Resolve, defining your grit. Your Resilience also comes with a Motivation, which is a single word or phrase describing what drives your character forwards. See @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.pa22HaRw1OBBQaDg]{Fate &amp; Resilience} for more on all of these.</p><h4>Determining Fate and Resilience</h4><p>You start with a base value for Fate and Resilience, and then have a number of Extra Points to spread between these two Attributes as you see fit. The numbers for these are shown in the Attributes Table. The more points you allocate to Fate, the luckier you are. By comparison, a higher Resilience shows you can steel through any situation.</p><h4>Determining Fortune and Resolve</h4><p>Your initial Fortune is equal to your Fate. Your initial Resolve equals your Resilience. Mark all four values on your sheet.</p><h4>Determining Motivation</h4><p>All characters choose a Motivation. It represents your Character’s core essence, a word or phrase that sums up what you live for. In addition to the obvious roleplaying benefits for portraying your character, Motivation is used to help you regain Resolve points. When considering your Motivation, think of something that is fundamental to your character’s nature. Also try to make your Motivation something fun to roleplay, and something that will work well with the other PCs and their motivations.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Gustavus, a young Scholar at the University in Altdorf, has ‘Thrillseeker’ for his Motivation. He lives his life in pursuit of excitement and danger, and Gustavus may regain Resolve points when he actively seeks out risky situations; perhaps he provokes antagonism in taverns, or deliberately breaks the law by stealing the feathers from the caps of State Soldiers. </em></p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Clotilda, a Reiksguard Knight, has ‘Protect the weak’ as her Motivation. She is driven to stand up to bullies and braggarts, risking life and limb to save the Reikland’s citizenry. Clotilda will regain her Resolve whenever she rescues others, or puts herself in harm’s way to protect another.</em></p><p><strong>Example</strong><em>: Ebba is a ‘Rebellious’ apprentice wizard studying at the Light College. She loves to break the rules of the College, flaunting her master’s authority, and poking her nose into books best left undisturbed. She regains Resolve whenever she breaks the rules set for her by superiors.</em></p><p>Other examples of potential motivations include: a ‘Perfectionist’, who loves to plan meticulously and draws energy from flawless execution of schemes; a ‘Nurturer’, who gains strength from caring for others, or rescuing them from difficult situations; a ‘Penitent Martyr’, who revels in hardship to atone for past misdeeds; or a ‘Shining Wit’, who’s ever engaging in witty badinage and banter to lighten the mood. If you can’t think of a Motivation don’t worry. One may arise as you create more of your character, and the other players and the GM can always help. Even if you do have one, it’s possible you may change your mind later. @UUID[.qBchGIhdjGocmbjU]{Step 8) Bringing Your Character To Life} is a good time to reconsider what your Motivation will be.</p><h4>Movement (M)</h4><p>Movement is used to determine your Walk and Run speed. Standard Human Movement is 4. If using a grid for movement this indicates how many squares you can move in a Round, or inches across the table top. Over the longer term it indicates how many miles per hour you can comfortably travel on foot. For more on Movement, see @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.bdfiyhEYtKs7irqc]{Moving}</p><table style=\"height:85px;width:40.3013%\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Movement</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Walk</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Run</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">6</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">12</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">16</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">20</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Advance Characteristics</h3><p>Upon selecting a career as \"Current\", you will see small \"plus\" symbols appear next to certain characteristics.

Forenames include:</p><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Adhemar, Anders, Artur, Beatrijs, Clementia, Detlev, Erika, Frauke, Frederich, Gerner, Gertraud, Haletha, Heinrich, Helga, Henryk, Irmina, Jehanne, Karl, Kruger, Lorelay, Marieke, Sebastien, Sigfreda, Talther, Talunda, Ulrich, Ulrika, Werther, Willelma, Wilryn.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Human Names And Their Origins</em></h3><p><em>Human names in WFRP are often taken from the real world, making it easy to research fun names online. The Reikland and much of The Empire uses Germanic names, the Wasteland has Dutch and Belgian influences, and Bretonnian names are loosely medieval French.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>Names are generated as part of the <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">/char</span> command, alternatively you can use the <span style=\"font-family:Courier New\">/name</span> command</p></blockquote><p>In the Reikland, Human family surnames passed on from one generation to the next are most common in cities and towns, while in villages Humans are more likely to take on an individual surname when they reach adulthood. It’s common to take a surname from where you were born, such as ‘Wilhelm of Auerswald’. The nobility often have two surnames, one is the name of their House and the other is preceded by ‘von’ to indicate where their family holds land, such as Graf Zenechar Trott von Tahme, though individual family traditions vary widely.</p><p>The most common surnames are derived from your occupation, or the occupation of a parent or grandparent. Examples include: Bauer (Farmer), Fleischer (Butcher), Schmidt (Smith), and Schuster (Cobbler). If a character has a particularly noticeable physical trait, this might be used as a surname. This can often be passed down from parents to children too, which can become confusing for literal-minded Dwarfs who may not understand a short person claiming to be Lang (Tall). Some other examples include: Augenlos (one eye), Dunn (very thin), Laut (loud voice), Stark (Strong).</p><h4>Dwarf Names</h4><p>Dwarf names are comprised of a forename, a surname, and a clan name.</p><p><strong>Dwarf Forenames</strong></p><p>Dwarf names tend to be short and sturdy like the people they represent, and are most commonly given to celebrate important ancestors, although individual clan traditions vary. Another common practice is to use a birthname to describe a key trait of a newborn in Khazalid, the Dwarf native language.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Alrik, Bronda, Dimzad, Fenna, Gottri, Gudrun, Snorri.</p><p><strong>Khazalid examples</strong>: Baragaz (Cannon Mouth), Durak (Hard), Galazil (Golden Haired), Gnoldok (Wise Eyes), Nazril (Shimmering), Okri (Crafter)</p><p><strong>Dwarf Surnames</strong></p><p>Dwarf surnames are based on who raised the Dwarf, with the following suffixes the most common in use: </p><ul><li><p><strong>sdottir</strong>: Daughter of…</p></li><li><p><strong>snev</strong>: Nephew of…</p></li><li><p><strong>sniz</strong>: Niece of…</p></li><li><p><strong>sson</strong>: Son of…</p></li></ul><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Ariksson, Grunnasdottir, Skagnev, Sovrissniz</p><p>It’s common as Dwarfs age and accrue deeds to their names to adopt a nickname based on physical appearance, prowess, or deed. These are usually bestowed by clan consensus, and it’s considered dishonourable to give a name that doesn’t represent the true character of a Dwarf. If such a nickname is adopted, it usually replaces the surname completely. So, Gerka Kardadottir would become Gerka Blackhand if she took the nickname ‘Blackhand’. Sometimes a nickname is marked in Khazalid, but Dwarfs usually translate such to Reikspiel in order to better explain themselves.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong>: Axebringer, Finehand, Forkbeard, Ironbraid, Redhammer, Stonefist</p><h4>Clan Name</h4><p>Finally, all Dwarfs bear a Clan Name (assuming they have not abandoned Dwarf tradition, which some Dwarfs living in the Empire have, especially rogue engineers). The Clan Name is always derived from the ancestor who founded the Clan, and is often sourced in a Nickname, often expressed in Khazalid. In practice, Dwarfs rarely use their Clan Name outside Dwarf society.</p><p><strong>Common Reikland Clans</strong>: Ardrungan, Bryntok, Gazani, Gromheld, Harrazlings, Unboki</p><p><strong>Common Grey Mountain Clans</strong>: Dokkintroll, Ganvalgger, Kvitang, Thrungtak, Wyrgrinti, Zankonk</p><h4>Elf Names</h4><p>Elves normally only admit to having names comprising of a forename and an epithet when wandering the Reikland.</p><p><strong>Elf Forenames</strong></p><p>The Elves use a naming system quite incomprehensible to outsiders. Eltharin (the common language of High Elves and Wood Elves, which has many dialects) is a language that relies on more than simple syllables to convey meaning. The easiest way to create an Elf name is to use the Elf Name Generator.</p><p><strong>Elf Epithets</strong></p><p>When travelling foreign lands, Elves typically present themselves with a forename and an epithet rather than attempt to explain the deeper concepts of Kindreds, Kinbands, or Houses. These epithets are always translated into Reikspiel as they are much easier for other species to pronounce and understand. Among High Elves, epithets usually describe character traits and physical appearance, but can be more obscure. Wood Elf epithets typically reference the natural world so beloved by the forest kin.</p><p><strong>High Elf examples</strong>: Emberfell, Fireborn, Foamheart, Goldenhair, Silverspray, Spellsign</p><p><strong>Wood Elf examples</strong>: Fleetriver, Shadowstalker, Treeshaper, Weavewatcher, Willowlimb, Windrunner</p><h4>Halfling Names</h4><p>Halfling names are comprised of a given name and a clan name at a minimum, with middle names included to ensure family trees are not confused.</p><p><strong>Halfling Forenames</strong></p><p>Halflings proudly bear grand names drawn from their long family trees, but they rarely use these outside official business. Normally, they are known by a cosy-sounding shortened form of their ancestral name. Some Halfling’s diminutives are completely unrelated to their formal names and are instead more descriptive, like Rosie or Scrumper. </p><p>Halflings place great stock in their achievements and some elders will only answer to nicknames related to their job, such as Gaffer, Guv, or Nan. Halflings also have long had a habit of emulating their neighbours to the point that many grand, formerly-Human names have now become ‘traditional’ Halfling names. </p><p><strong>Examples (with diminutives)</strong>: Antoniella (Anni), Esmerelda (Esme), Ferdinand (Fred), Heironymus (Hiro), Maximilian (Max), Theodosius (Theo), Thomasina (Tina)</p><p><strong>Halfling Clan Names</strong></p><p>Halfling clan names are almost exclusively related to food and drink, geographical or natural features, or personal characteristics of the ancestor who first took the name. Halflings who have the same surname are always related and can usually tell you exactly how. </p><p>Human’s tendency to have the same surname despite being unrelated causes confusion among some Halflings, who will happily pinch pies from a Schmidt on one street because a Schmidt on another street short-changed them. </p><p><strong>Common Reikland Clans</strong>: Ashfield, Brandysnap, Hayfoot, Rumster, Shortbottom, Thorncobble</p><h3>Physical Details</h3><p>When it comes to cosmetic physical details — those aspects of your appearance that don’t influence the game directly — you may either roll them randomly or choose from the range available to your Species. </p><h4>Age</h4><p>Average natural lifespans are around 60 for a Human, 120 for Halflings, and over 200 for a Dwarf, while Elves don’t appear to age at all and have been known to live for a thousand years or more. Choose your Character’s age or use the /char command.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Human</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Dwarf</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Elf</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Halfling</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 15+d10 # Human Age]]</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 15 + 10d10 # Dwarf Age]]</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 30 + 10d10 # Elf Age]]</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">[[/r 15 + 5d10 # Halfling Age]]</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While most species roll once on the table below, Elves may roll twice: their innately magical natures mean they often have variegated colours, such as sapphire blue flecked with gold, or a mottled mixture of mossy green and warm chestnut.</p><p>@Table[eyes]</p><h4>Hair Colour</h4><p>All species barring Elves have hair that slowly turns grey as they move through middle age, then eventually turns white as they reach old age. </p><p>By comparison, Elves seem eternally youthful, never showing any signs of age. Humans and Dwarfs may also have significant facial hair, which is usually the same colour as head hair, but not always.</p><p>@Table[hair]</p><h4>Height</h4><p>Average heights are: Dwarf (4’8”), Elf (6’5”), Halfling (3’6”), with Humans varying much more widely, averaging somewhere around 5’9” in the Reikland.

All characters have both a Short-Term and Long-Term Ambition. </p><h4>Choosing Ambitions</h4><p>Consult with your GM when choosing your Ambitions. Your GM has final say on the acceptability of an Ambition, and whether it is short-term or long-term. Should you wish to change an Ambition, you may do so between sessions. </p><h4>Short-term Ambitions</h4><p>Short-term Ambitions represent your immediate goals. They are outcomes you wish to achieve within days and weeks, possibly sooner. Under normal circumstances, a short-term Ambition should take at least two or three sessions to complete.</p><p>Example short-term Ambitions include: </p><ul><li><p>Ruining the reputation of a romantic rival.</p></li><li><p>Avenging a fallen comrade.</p></li><li><p>Befriending a reclusive scholar. </p></li></ul><h4>Long-term Ambitions</h4><p>Long-term Ambitions are goals you will need to work on for months or years to complete, and may never be achieved at all, perhaps taken more as a description of a primary motivation in your life than a realistic outcome.</p><p>Examples of long-term Ambitions include: </p><ul><li><p>Owning your own coaching inn.</p></li><li><p>Building your village into a thriving town.</p></li><li><p>Ridding the Colleges of Magic of Elven influence. </p></li></ul><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Options: Nefarious Plans</em></h3><p><em>You may want to keep your Ambitions secret from other players in your party, especially if they are controversial or clandestine. If you want to overthrow the Emperor, or legalise Necromancy in the Reikland, chances are your Witch Hunter ally won’t approve!</em></p></blockquote><h4>Achieving Your Ambitions</h4><p>If you achieve your short-term Ambition, you will receive a bonus of +50 XP, and can choose a new short-term Ambition at the end of the session.  If you achieve your long-term Ambition, you may either:</p><ul><li><p>Receive a bonus of +500 XP and choose a new long-term Ambition at the end of the session. </p></li><li><p>Retire your Character — who becomes an NPC under your GM’s control — and gain a bonus of half your earned XP of your current character to spend on your next character.</p></li></ul><p>Retired Characters will generally stay in place to take advantage of their achieved ambition. You can build them into the background of your new Character, so that they may continue to help you. If you want to reactivate a retired Character, talk to your GM about how best to bring that into the current story. Retiring Characters allows you to build a network across the Old World, and can be a great source of adventure leads. </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":700000,"ownership":{"default":-1,"FIIsUxJ6xGvEDRPV":3},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}},"title":{"show":true,"level":2},"system":{}},{"name":"7) Party","type":"text","_id":"2YaSdbUwpO1UaNFI","image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Now you have almost finished making your Character, you need to consider the other players in your party.

Some players write detailed backstories for their Character, especially if they are very familiar with the Old World. Others prefer to just decide the basics at the start, and then improvise during the game (discuss this with the GM beforehand so you don’t derail any storylines). At the start of the Character creation process we recommended that you talk to the other players and the GM about the kind of group you want to create, and we revisited that while creating Party ambitions. This is the perfect place to complete that process, weaving your Characters’ stories together and binding them into a tight-knit group with their own reasons for sticking together.</p><h3>Ten Questions</h3><p>One useful technique for creating an interesting background for your Character is to answer a series of questions about them — here are ours! If any of these questions make you want to change something about the character you’ve created so far... do so! For instance, if you add in some detail about your childhood, you may want to revisit the choices you made in @UUID[.f5Y4XenZVtDU2GUo]{4) Skills and Talents}. </p><h4>Where are you from?</h4><p>Do you come from one of Reikland’s bustling towns, or a sleepy village? Perhaps your childhood was spent on a remote farmstead, or maybe you called the winding back alleys of Altdorf home? Do you hail from a deep mountain hold, or were your days spent threading the roads and riverways of Reikland, always on the move? See @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD]{Glorious Reikland} for details on the geography and settlements of this corner of the Empire.</p><h4>What is your family like?</h4><p>It may take a village to raise a child, but it’s your kin who do the heavy lifting. What were your parents’ occupations? Are they still alive? Do you have any siblings? Were you close, or were you constantly at one another’s throats? Grandparents? Nephews, nieces, cousins? Children, even? Does your family approve of your career choice? Are they proud of you, or are you a stain on your family’s honour? </p><h4>What was your childhood like?</h4><p>Was your family home full of love, or was it a cold, inhospitable place? Were you coddled, or did you have to fend for yourself? Were you educated, and if so, by whom: a tutor, a family member, a village school, or the local priest? Were you trained in the family business, or were you sent from home, fostered elsewhere or raised in an orphanage? </p><h4>Why did you leave home?</h4><p>Do you still live in your childhood home, or did you leave? If so, when? Were you drawn by the promise of excitement of life in the big city? Are you in search of riches, or renown? Are you running from something, or trying to find meaning or purpose in your life?</p><h4>Who are your best friends?</h4><p>While you cannot choose your family, your friends are another matter entirely, and you can tell a lot about someone by the friends they keep. Do you have any friends from childhood? Or friends you’ve made since leaving home? What do you do together? Drink? Gamble? Debate? Are your allies in your party your best friends? Or do you eschew civilised company in favour of a loyal pet? </p><h4>What is your greatest desire?</h4><p>What is the fire that burns in your heart? Your Ambitions may be your chief goal, but ambitions are often prosaic or banal. If you could have anything, anything at all, what would it be? </p><h4>What are your best and worst memories?</h4><p>We are the sum of our experiences; they shape and mould us, forging us anew. What are your most treasured memories? An afternoon of glorious summer sunshine? A passionate kiss, while huddling from rain, beneath sheltering boughs? A victory scored in a battle of wits or brawn? And what are your less fond recollections? A painful humiliation? A scheme thwarted? The end of a long-term partnership, romantic or business? The hatred, disdain, or, worse, disinterest of your peers?</p><h4>What are your religious beliefs?</h4><p>Most folk of the Empire are polytheistic; the existence, and puissance, of the gods is undeniable, and so their veneration is a matter of course. That being said, not all of the gods are favoured equally. </p><p>Does your character have a fondness or affinity for one god in particular? Do you cross your fingers for luck, appealing to Ranald? Do you make the sign of the Twin Tailed Comet at your enemy, or mutter an angry prayer to Ulric before battle? See @UUID[JournalEntry.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon]{Religion and Belief} for details of the gods and their ways. </p><h4>To whom, or what, are you loyal?</h4><p>Will you protect your friends above all, or are the ties that bind you to your clan, kinfolk, or partner stronger than iron? Or are you a pious soul, dedicated above all to your god? Or are you loyal to your community, to Reikland, the Empire… or just to yourself? </p><h4>Why are you adventuring?</h4><p>And this is the big one: why are you a player character, and not just another citizen of the Empire. Why are you adventuring?</p><p>Have you consciously chosen a life of adventure? Are you seeking out the enemies of the Empire, or a big pay day? Or was this life thrust upon you, against your will. Are you seeking justice, or vengeance, or is your adventuring life nothing more than a fight to clear your name, or survive your enemies?</p><p>Answer all of those, and you will have a fully fleshed out character, ready to go. But, before you start playing, did you gain any bonus XP during the character creation process? If so, you may wish to spend it before you begin play.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Options: Psychology</em></h3><p><em>When you are creating your Character’s story, you might feel you should have powerful emotions such as @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.psychologies.jbQDTxc4QNZDLaXm]{Love}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.psychologies.EBmSCscpk4vEDCD3]{Camaraderie}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.E98mVLZgE8bX5vQW]{Hatred} etc towards family members, situations, enemies or other features of their life.

Sometimes, the GM will make a call based on your abilities and any other factors and decide that you achieved what you were attempting, or that you didn’t. If the GM isn’t sure of the outcome, or if the situation is significant or dangerous, they can resolve the action using the rules. There are a few options, as the <strong>Using Tests</strong> box shows. Tests compare a dice roll to one of the characteristics or skills on your character sheet and provide an outcome.</p><h3>Simple Tests</h3><p>Simple Tests are used when you need to determine if your character succeeds or fails at a simple task. Does Molli leap the churning stream? Can Wilhelm charm a lower price from the truculent merchant? Often, a quick yes or no answer to these questions allows your adventure to progress swiftly. The exception to this is when a failure would significantly impact the progress of the adventure, in which case you should use a @UUID[.lQThXbnpgQ30VBXR#dramatic-tests]{Dramatic Test} instead.</p><p>To perform a Simple Test, you roll d100 and compare the result rolled to the Skill or Characteristic best suited to the action you are attempting.</p><p>Note this test may be modified by the GM if it is notably easy or hard to complete (see @UUID[.lQThXbnpgQ30VBXR#difficulty]{Difficulty}).</p><p>If you roll lower or equal to the Skill or Characteristic, the Test’s outcome is a success, and your Character performs the task.</p><p>If you roll higher than the Skill or Characteristic, the Test’s outcome is a failure, and your Character does not perform the task.</p><p>Whatever the outcome of the Test, after testing, the GM should describe what just happened so everyone understands how the Test has impacted the story.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Molli runs across Altdorf ’s Königsplatz on a cold, winter’s night. The cobbles are blanketed in thick snow hiding treacherous ice beneath, but with a gang of thugs in eager pursuit Molli is not about to slacken her pace. The GM calls for a Simple Athletics Test to see if Molli can cross the slippery platz safely. Molli’s Athletics is 42, and her player rolls d100 scoring a 17. As 17 is below Molli’s Athletics of 42, the result is a success, so the answer is yes, Molli can cross without mishap. The GM says that Molli crosses the open snow and darts into the relative safety of one of the many dark alleyways at the other side. If her player had rolled over 42, Molli would have slipped, and the thugs would have been upon her!</em></p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/spot-glove-blade.webp\" width=\"205\" height=\"181\" /></div><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>TALENTS AND TESTS</em></h3><p><em>Some Talents can improve a Test’s chances of success, or grant you access to unique Tests allowing you to attempt extraordinary feats.

Equally, there is always a chance of success in <strong>WFRP</strong>, no matter the odds stacked against you.</p><p>If you roll 96–00 on any Test, it is always a failure. A failure occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is 96 or higher. Similarly, if you roll 01–05 on a Test, it is always a success.

The following explains these in detail:</em></p><p><em>Rolling a Double: Rolling a double means both the tens and the units die of a percentile test have rolled the same number. For example: 11, 22, 33, 44 and so on.</em></p><p><em>Reroll: A reroll is when you disregard the result of a dice roll, and roll it again. Once a Test has been rerolled, it cannot be rerolled again under normal circumstances.</em></p><p><em>Reverse: To reverse a percentile roll, you swap the tens result with the units result. So, a roll of 58 becomes 85, or a roll of 51 becomes 15. Obviously, if you roll a double, it will have the same result when reversed, so 77 reverses to 77.</em></p><p><em>Modifiers: These numbers are added or subtracted to the one of your Skill to make the Test easier or more difficult. This is most often referred to as the @UUID[.lQThXbnpgQ30VBXR#difficulty]{Difficulty} of the roll.</em></p><p><em>If you want to introduce some test-specific outcomes for particularly dramatic moments, you can use the methods above as a toolkit.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Dramatic Tests</h3><p>Simply knowing if you pass or fail is not always enough; sometimes, it is useful to know how well you succeed or how badly you fail a Test. This is especially the case when pitching your Skills against another (see Opposed Tests), which is often the case for magic and combat. So, when you want to know exactly how well or badly you have performed a Test, use a Dramatic Test. Another reason for choosing a Dramatic Test is when the progress of the adventure could depend on the Test. Dramatic Tests provide outcomes rather than straight success or failure, which means that even if the test is ‘failed’ the adventure continues, albeit in a more challenging way than if you had achieved a success. Dramatic Tests are handled in the same way as Simple Tests, and still provide success or failure as outcomes, but the results have more detail. This detail is governed by Success Levels.</p><h4>Success Levels</h4><p>Success Levels (shortened to SL) are used to describe the effectiveness of a Test. To determine the SL of a Test, subtract the 10s number of the rolled dice from the 10s number of the Characteristic or Skill being tested, including any modifiers (see Difficulty for more on modifiers). The higher the SL, the better the outcome; the lower it is, the worse things have gone. Marginal results, where you succeed or fail a Test with +0 or –0 SL, could either be interpreted as succeeding or failing by a whisker, with minimal consequences either good or bad, or could give inconclusive results allowing you try again.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Eichengard is careering across muddy fields atop his stallion, desperately fleeing the lands of a disgruntled noble when a wall blocks his passage. He decides to push his mount to jump, and the GM calls for a <strong>Dramatic Ride (Horse)</strong> test. Eichengard rolls 29 against his Ride (Horse) skill of 41. The 10s number of the Skill being tested is 4, and the 10s number rolled was 2, so the test succeeds with +2 SL (4–2=2) and he clears the wall with space to spare. Buoyed by his success, Eichengard twists around in his saddle and makes the sign of the twin-tailed comet at the horsemen pursuing him. Unfortunately, this means he’s not paying attention to where he’s going. The GM calls for a <strong>Dramatic Perception</strong> Test, and Eichengard’s player rolls 82, significantly higher than Eichengard’s Perception skill of 39. The 10s number of the roll is 8, and the 10s number of the skill being tested is 3, so the test has failed with –5 SL (3–8=–5). He has failed rather badly. As Eichengard laughs at the increasingly distant guards sent to capture him, a low-lying branch slams hard into his side, knocking him flying.</em></p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Options: Tests Above 100%</em></h3><p><em>Having exceptional abilities makes it quite possible that a modified Characteristic or Skill may be 100% or higher when tested. If this occurs in your game, you may wish to use the following optional rule to help represent such an awesome figure.</em></p><p><em>A successful Test gains a bonus of +1 SL for each full 10% a tested Characteristic or Skill exceeds 100%.</em></p><p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz has a Charm Skill of 115%: her Fellowship characteristic of 80% plus her Charm advances of +35% (see @UUID[JournalEntry.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.84Aj04uEEBh3yTS3#advancing-through-your-career]{Advances} for more on this); thus, if she succeeds at a Charm Test, she gains a bonus of +1 SL over an above what she earns by rolling or from any applicable Talents.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Options: Fast SL</em></h3><p><em>Determining your SL involves some simple mathematics, so calculating it can slow play during fraught scenes. Fortunately, there is a fast way to calculate SL for those looking to keep their games as fast as possible. When you pass a Test, use the result of the tens die as your SL. So, if you passed a Test with a roll of 36, you score +3 SL. With this optional rule, the closer you roll to your tested Skill, the better, rather than rolling low being best. If a Test fails, you calculate SL as normal, taking your rolled tens die from your tested Skill to determine your negative SL.</em></p></blockquote><p>Exactly how well you succeed or fail is shown in the Outcomes Table, which can be used to inspire descriptions of what just happened. Much like simple tests offer a yes or no in answer to ‘do I succeed at this test?’, dramatic tests also provide answers, just more of them.</p><p>If you automatically succeed due to rolling 01–05 (see @UUID[.lQThXbnpgQ30VBXR#automatic-failure-and-success]{Automatic Failure and Success}), you score +1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is higher.</p><p>If you automatically fail due to rolling 96–00 (see @UUID[.lQThXbnpgQ30VBXR#automatic-failure-and-success]{Automatic Failure and Success}), you score –1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is lower.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Outcomes Table</em></h3><table style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>SL</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Result</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Have You Succeeded?</strong></em></td><th> </th></tr><tr><td><em>+6 or more</em></td><td><em>Astounding Success</em></td><td><em><strong>Yes, perfectly!</strong>: The result is as good as it can be, perhaps with extra luck and fortunate coincidences thrown in!</em></td><th> </th></tr><tr><td><em>+4 to +5</em></td><td><em>Impressive Success</em></td><td><em><strong>Yes, and…</strong>: You achieve your goal with style, exceeding your expectations.</em></td><th> </th></tr><tr><td><em>+2 to +3</em></td><td><em>Success</em></td><td><em><strong>Yes</strong>: You achieve a solid success.</em></td><th> </th></tr><tr><td><em>+0 to +1</em></td><td><em>Marginal Success</em></td><td><em><strong>Yes, but…</strong>: You more or less achieve what you intend, but imperfectly, and perhaps with an unpredictable side effect.</em></td><th> </th></tr><tr><td><em>-1 to -0</em></td><td><em>Marginal Failure</em></td><td><em><strong>No, but…</strong>: You marginally fail, perhaps accomplishing a portion of what you intended.</em></td><th> </th></tr><tr><td><em>-2 to -3</em></td><td><em>Failure</em></td><td><em><strong>No</strong>: You just plain do it wrong.</em></td><th> </th></tr><tr><td><em>-4 to -5</em></td><td><em>Impressive Failure</em></td><td><em><strong>No, and…</strong>: Not only do you mess up, but you also cause additional things to go wrong.</em></td><th> </th></tr><tr><td><em>-6 or less</em></td><td><em>Astounding Failure</em></td><td><em><strong>No, not in any way!</strong>: Everything goes wrong in the worst possible way.

They can also be used to add drama for all Tests, creating a game that feels epic in scope as extreme results become commonplace. If that describes your group, you could use the following optional rule.</em></p><p><em>Any Test scoring a success that also rolls a double is called a Critical, meaning you’ve scored an Astounding Success from the Outcome Table; and any failure including a double is a Fumble, resulting in an Astounding Failure from the Outcome Table. This optional rule works well with Simple Tests, providing a fun addition to the yes or no results offered there.</em></p><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Characteristic Tests</em></h3><p><em>Sometimes you may want to do something that is not covered by one of the Skills. In these rare cases, you make a Characteristic Test instead of a Skill Test. The GM determines the most appropriate Characteristic for what you are attempting, and you Test it as normal.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Difficulty</h3><p>Not all Tests are equal. Climbing a fence is laughably easy but ascending the face of a sheer cliff is incredibly tough. To represent this, the GM assigns bonuses or penalties to Tests called the Difficulty . While published adventures define the difficulty for the GM — for example: calling for a <strong>Hard (–20) Research</strong> test — there are many instances where the GM has to determine them on the fly. Making judgments like this is one of the most common functions of the GM. For each Test, whether simple or dramatic, the GM should decide the Difficulty and then consult the Difficulty Table to determine the appropriate modifier. GMs may choose to assign even greater bonuses or penalties than those shown on the table, but such modifiers should only be used in extreme situations.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Valentyn, a Jade Wizard, tries to find the tracks of an unruly stag he is hunting. Under normal circumstances, he would perform an Average (+20) Track Test with his skill of 41, thus test against 61; however, the GM decides that as the rain last night washed away most of the tracks the task is Very Hard and imposes a –30 penalty. Therefore, Valentyn has to roll 11 or under (41–30=11) to succeed. He rolls a 35, which would have been a success under normal circumstances, but in this circumstance is a failure, indicating the rain has foiled the Jade Wizard’s attempt.</em></p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Difficulty Table</em></h3><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Difficulty</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>Test Modifier</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Very Easy</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>+60</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Easy</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>+40</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Average</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>+20</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Challenging</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>no modifier</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Difficult</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>-10</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Hard</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>-20</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Very Hard</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>-30</em></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/spot-glove-blade.webp\" width=\"205\" height=\"181\" /></div><h4>Opposed Tests</h4><p>Sometimes you match your capabilities directly against those of an opponent. The rules represent this with a special Dramatic Test called an Opposed Test. Opposed Tests are an important part of <strong>WFRP’s</strong> combat rules later in this chapter, but are used in many other situations, as well.</p><p>An Opposed Test is handled just like any other Dramatic Test, but both parties make a Test. The party with the highest SL wins the Test. If both participants score the same SL, the party with the higher tested Skill or Characteristic wins. In the unlikely event there is still a tie, then one of two things, as determined by the GM, occurs: 1) there is a stalemate, and nothing happens; 2) both parties re-roll until there is a clear winner.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Having floored an important Reiklander baron at a party, Salundra makes to leave the ballroom; however, some uneasy guardsmen block her passage, knowing they really should detain the noble captain. Salundra scowls as she approaches.</em></p><p><em>The GM calls for an Intimidate Test and opposes it with the guardsmen’s commanding officer’s Leadership Test. Both the player and the GM roll. Salundra’s Intimidate is 47. The officer’s Leadership is 46. Salundra rolls a 04, scoring +4 SL (4–0=4), while the GM rolls 16, scoring +3 SL (4–1=3). As Salundra’s SL is higher (4 to the officer’s 3), she successfully intimidates the guards, who let her pass with barely a grumble.</em></p><p>Like any other Tests, some Opposed Tests are easier or harder than others, so the GM may decide modifiers are required. In most cases, these modifiers are applied equally to both sides, but not always. If no Difficulty is marked for an Opposed Test, it is assumed to be <strong>Challenging (+0)</strong>.</p><p>If it is important to know how well the winner of the Opposed Test won, use the difference between the two results to determine a final SL.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>It’s Pie Week, an annual week-long festival for everyone’s favourite baked goods, and Salundra has entered a pie-eating contest. She’s reached the final, and it’s her versus Fat Tom Brandysnap, the Ubersreik Pie Eating Champion for the last 5 years running, and a Halfling wider than he is tall.</em></p><p><em>The GM calls for an Opposed Endurance Test. Salundra has an Endurance of 45 and Fat Tom has 63. Salundra is possibly in trouble! Dice roll, and Salundra rolls 51, scoring –1 SL. Sali’s looking a little green! But Fat Tom’s looking worse! He rolls 91 for –3 SL. So, even though she’s failed her Endurance roll, she still wins the Opposed Test by 2 SL, though she’ll probably be bringing up most of those pies later!</em></p><h4>Extended Tests</h4><p>Sometimes the adventure will call for a specific number of Success Levels be achieved to fully succeed at a time-consuming or especially taxing task. Doing this requires a special Dramatic Test called an Extended Test. Extended Tests are handled in the same fashion as any other Dramatic Test, but the SL scored from multiple rolls are added together to reach a specified target. If the total SL scored ever falls below 0, you can start again from scratch with the next roll.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>On the run again, Molli is attempting to pick an unexpectedly complex lock before she is discovered. The GM states the lock requires 5 Success Levels with a <strong>Challenging (+0) Pick Lock</strong> Test to pry open, and that she only has three Rounds before the guard arrives. Molli’s Pick Lock skill is 58, so she has a good chance of managing it, but time isn’t on her side. Unfortunately for her, her first Test scores 63: –1 SL and a terrible start, she’s made no progress and will start from scratch next round. Cursing under her breath as footsteps draw closer, Molli tries again, this time scoring 11, for +4 SL! She feels tension in her picks as the lock almost springs, but she also hears the approaching guard is even closer.</em></p><p><em>The GM explains the next Test is the last one before the guard arrives, so Molli can either abandon her attempt and avoid the guard or make a desperate effort to secure the last SL she needs to pick the lock. Knowing she needs to escape, Molli risks the last Test and rolls, scoring… 42! That’s +1 SL, taking her to a total of 5. The lock opens with a click! Triumphant, Molli slips through the door and closes it behind her just before the guard arrives.</em></p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Options: Extended Tests and 0 SL</em></h3><p><em>Rolling 0 Sl in an Extended Test does not benefit or hinder the running SL total, which can feel a little odd given you either passed or failed the Test, and that should perhaps come with some advantage or penalty. If this is an issue for you, use the following optional rule. A successful Test adds a minimum of +1 SL to the cumulative total, and a failed Test removes a minimum of –1 SL from the total.</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/picking-lock.webp\" /></div><h3>Assistance</h3><p>In some situations, multiple Characters working together have a better chance of completing a task than a Character attempting it alone. With the GM’s permission, a Character can assist another Character who is about to take a Test. When doing so, the Character with the best chance to succeed rolls the dice.</p><p>Each Character assisting provides a bonus of +10 to the Test. Other than that, the Test is rolled as normal.</p><h4>Limits on Assistance</h4><p>Characters can assist each other in most tasks; however, there are limits.</p><ul><li><p>To assist you require at least 1 Advance in the Skill being tested.</p></li><li><p>Assisting Characters must normally be adjacent to the Character taking the Test.</p></li><li><p>You may not assist on Tests made to resist disease, poison, fear, hazards, or anything else the GM deems inappropriate.</p></li><li><p>You may not be assisted by more Characters than you have in the appropriate @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.GaZa9sU4KjKDswMr#characteristic-bonuses]{Characteristic Bonus }.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Adhemar, Perdita, and Valentyn hastily search a room when its owner, an aging merchant, leaves to find some records. The GM declares a <strong>Difficult (–10) Perception</strong> Test is required. Since Perdita and Valentyn both have the Perception Skill and are helping, Adhemar (who has the highest Perception Skill, at 59) gains a bonus of +20 to his Perception Test, for a combined total of 69 (59–10+20=69). However, he rolls 74, and fails, meaning all three characters have failed to find anything useful before the hobbling merchant returns.</em></p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Options: Combining Skills</em></h3><p><em>Sometimes, you may be in a situation where you feel two Skills should be tested by the same character for a single task, so it may be appropriate to combine those Skills for a single Test. There are generally two reasons to do this: 1) is faster and limits the number of dice rolls required to press on with the game; 2) having to pass two Tests in a row to perform a single task significantly reduces your chance of passing overall.</em></p><p><em>The simplest way to do this is to attempt both Skills with one Test, comparing a single percentile roll to each Skill number. If both pass, you succeed at the Test. If only one passes, you partially pass as appropriate. And, obviously, if both fail, you have failed the Test.</em></p><p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>After a string of unlikely events, Salundra finds herself on-stage in yellow and red tights, singing and dancing in the Vargr Breughel Memorial Playhouse’s inaugural production of ‘Tell Me On A Festag’. The GM calls for a Challenging Combined Perform (Dance) and Entertain (Sing) Test, thinking it unfair Salundra should have to enact each Test in turn as that would significantly reduce her overall chance of success. Salundra has Perform (Dance) at 53 from her time in court, but doesn’t have Entertain (Sing), so must use her Fellowship of 43. She then rolls 46, meaning she managed the dance (succeeded with +1 SL), but hit a few off-notes with her singing (failed at -0 SL) — not perfect, but good enough for the gathered crowds; though Kym Neumann, the Altdorf Spieler’s theatre critic, may not be writing a favourable review...</p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/spot-pouch.webp\" width=\"308\" height=\"220\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"name":"Combat","type":"text","_id":"wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Sooner or later you will need to stop someone in their tracks, or someone will try to stop you. When diplomacy fails, is not attempted, or is not understood as a basic concept, Combat begins!</p><p>In Combat, lots of individuals take actions in a short space of time, many of them in direct opposition to each other. You will still be taking Tests to resolve these actions, but timing and a host of other factors become more important, so we have some rules to make everything work.</p><h3>Timing</h3><p>In Combat, the exact timing of actions matters more, so time is organised into:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rounds</strong>: A Round is enough time for all characters to attempt a Test and move into position. It’s normally a just few seconds, the GM can decide exactly how long if necessary.</p></li><li><p><strong>Turns</strong>: During a Round, each combatant has a Turn to perform an Action and a Move.</p></li><li><p><strong>Initiative Order</strong>: Each combatant usually takes their Turn in order of their Initiative Characteristic, from highest to lowest.</p></li></ul><h3>Combat Summary</h3><p>Combat follows these steps until one side flees or is defeated:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Determine Surprise</strong>: The GM determines if any characters are @Condition[Surprised]. This normally only happens on the first round of combat. See the section below.</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Begins</strong>: If the rules call for something to happen at the start of the Round, it happens now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Characters Take Turns</strong>: Each combatant takes a Turn in Initiative order, starting with the highest Initiative. Each Character can normally perform a Move and an Action on their Turn (see @UUID[.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#taking-your-turn]{Taking Your Turn}).</p></li><li><p><strong>Round Ends</strong>: The Round ends when all combatants have taken a Turn. If the rules call for something to happen at the <em>end of the Round</em>, it happens now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repeat Steps 2–5 As Required</strong>: Continue to play through Rounds until the combat is resolved.</p></li></ol><h3>Initiative Order</h3><p>Combatants act in Initiative order during the Round, with the highest Initiative acting first, until all involved have taken a Turn. If you want this to work quickly at the table, have the players sit in Initiative order. If multiple combatants have the same Initiative, they act in order from the highest Agility to the lowest. If they also have the same Agility, then roll an Opposed Agility Test, with the winner choosing who goes first for the combat. Some Talents impact combat order (see @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR]{Skills and Talents}).</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Tollich, with an Initiative of 38, always acts ahead of his companion, Perdita who has an Initiative of 33. If they attack a coven of cultists, each with Initiative 35, the combat order would be: Tollich (38), the Cultists (35), Perdita (33).</em></p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Roll For Initiative!</em></h3><p><em>Some groups prefer to randomise Initiative. There are several ways to do this, choose your favourite:</em></p><ul><li><p><em>Each character rolls an Initiative Test to determine a SL.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Initiative.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Agility Bonus + Initiative Bonus.</em></p></li></ul><p><em>The GM notes the results in decreasing numerical order and uses this as the Initiative Order. You could use this order for every Round (quickest option) or roll each Round (gives some variety to the order; slow characters have the chance to not always go last).</em></p><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Rounds Outside Combat</em></h3><p><em>Out of combat, the exact timing of those actions is usually flexible. Sometimes it is helpful to use Rounds outside of Combat to help organise everyone’s contributions; for example, Extended Tests happen over several rounds, with one Test taken each Round. (see @UUID[.lQThXbnpgQ30VBXR#extended-tests]{Extended Tests}).</em></p></blockquote><h3>Surprise</h3><p>Taking your enemy by surprise gives you a big advantage. If one side is planning an attack, they can attempt to harness the element of surprise by:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hiding</strong>: Make a successful Stealth Test in appropriate cover. Characters may oppose this with a Perception Test if they are wary, or if the GM is feeling generous.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sneaky Tactics</strong>: Attack from behind, in the dark, through heavy fog, or from above! The GM may allow a Perception Test to spot the incoming attackers if appropriate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Distractions</strong>: Loud bangs, milling crowds and an especially engaging sermon are just some of the distractions that could harbour a surprise attack!</p></li><li><p><strong>Unprepared Defenders</strong>: If the enemy are particularly unwary, the attackers automatically surprise their victims. Something Else: Other sneaky and ingenious plans concocted by cunning players — the GM has the final call on the possibility of surprise.</p></li></ul><p>If there is a chance the ambushers will be spotted, the GM will typically call for <strong>Opposed Stealth vs Perception</strong> Test, usually with the character with the worst Stealth opposing all potential spotters. If the ambusher wins, each defeated character gains the @Condition[Surprised] Condition.</p><p>If no-one is surprised, proceed with the combat as normal.</p><p>If anyone is surprised, they can use a Resolve point to remove the @Condition[Surprised] Condition.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Surprise Talents!</em></h3><p><em>Even in situations where the GM states there is no chance of spotting incoming ambushers, some Talents allow Surprise to be avoided. See @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR]{Skill and Talents} for more on this.</em></p><p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Tollich and Perdita fall foul of an ambush by gore-smeared Cultists of the Blood God. The combat begins when the Cultists storm from their hiding places, revealing their positions. The GM decides Tollich and Perdita are surprised as they were having a vigorous debate, and neither was at all prepared for an ambush. However, Tollich has the Combat Aware Talent, which grants a Challenging (+0) Perception Test to avoid Surprise; for Tollich, this is 41. He rolls 23, showing his well-honed instincts have spotted something is wrong. So, for the first round, only Perdita takes the Surprised Condition; Tollich and the Cultists act as normal.</p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/beastmen-fight.webp\" /></div><h3>Taking Your Turn</h3><p>Combat is a dynamic, disorientating experience, with friend and foe desperately weaving around each other, blades flashing as thrust follows parry follows gunshot.</p><p>The GM describes the situation — where everyone is, what your surroundings are like — and you can ask for more details to flesh things out and help plan your action. ‘How thick is the chandelier rope? Could an arrow cut it?’, for example. When it’s your Turn, you’ll make your Move and take Action!</p><p>On your Turn you have a Move and an Action, you can take these in any order — it’s presumed you are probably doing both at the same time, and you can freely describe them as one combined manoeuvre. You can also skip taking an Action or Move, though you won’t get another opportunity until the next Round!</p><p>Vivid descriptions of what you do will bring the Combat to life. Rather than declare your action is, ‘hit the Goblin’, it’s much more fun to say, ‘I Kick the chair in front of me towards the Goblins and lunge with my sword at the closest one’s throat’. You never know, the GM might reward you with the odd bonus for great roleplaying. This goes for the resolution of your Action too — the GM will describe the outcome, but you can certainly embellish it!</p><h4>Move</h4><p>In most circumstances, exact distances don’t matter too much. Use your Movement Characteristic as a guide to the ground you can cover, and the GM will let you know if the move will take more than one Turn. Reaching difficult places, perhaps by climbing or jumping, will also use your Action if you need to Test a Skill to get there (perhaps with a Climb or Athletics Test).</p><p>If you are not already fighting someone, you can also use your Move to Charge into close combat, gaining +1 Advantage (see @UUID[.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#advantage]{Advantage}). For more on this, and for a detailed breakdown of movement speeds, leaping distances, and more, see @UUID[.bdfiyhEYtKs7irqc]{Moving}.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/spot-crossed-pistols.webp\" width=\"186\" height=\"241\" /></div><h4>Action</h4><p>In combat, your Action is used to do something. Whether that’s swing a sword at a Mutant, jump from rooftop to rooftop, or take a moment to gauge the situation, that’s up to you. Your Action is only limited by your imagination, the physical constraints of the fight location and the capabilities of your Character.</p><p>Describe what you want your Character to do. The GM will then tell you if you need to make a Test to succeed at your planned Action. The results will then be narrated by you and the GM, ending your Action.</p><p>For a detailed breakdown of how to use your Action to attack another Character, refer to Attacking. If you would like to use prayers or magic, refer to either @UUID[JournalEntry.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon]{Religion and Belief} or @UUID[JournalEntry.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f]{Magic}. @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR]{Skills and Talents} also contains many examples of how to use your Skills during combat.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Molli looks on nervously from behind a barrel as Salundra is beset by the flying fists of three pub brawlers keen to put the young captain in her place. On her Turn, Molli’s player asks if the pub has an upper floor. The GM confirms it does, and that it has a balcony overlooking the fight. Smiling, the player declares Molli will sprint upstairs and push a table down on the fight to help break it up using both her Move and Action. Given the upper floor isn’t far away, the GM decides Molli can get there in a single Round but pushing the small table there will take a little effort.</em></p><p><em>The GM calls for an Average (+20) Athletics Test to heft the table over the balcony. Molli’s Athletics is 34, so she needs to roll 54 or under. She rolls 21, for +3 SL, and the table flies! Molli shouts out as the table tips: ‘Stop fighting!’ The GM states all combatants below must perform an Opposed Dodge Test against the +3 SL</em> or be hit by the table. Unfortunately, only Salundra fails this, and the table lands squarely on her head…</p><h4>Free Actions</h4><p>Some things you’ll want your Character to do won’t count as your Action for the round — such as shouting a warning, drawing your weapon, or drinking a potion. It’s the GM’s decision on what takes up your Action, and what you can do in a Round. A good general guide is that if an act requires you to make a Test, it is an Action rather than a Free Action.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Options: On The Defensive</em></h3><p><em>What if you want to prepare to dodge or parry incoming blows, to hold a defensive position in a doorway, or use Language (Magick) to deploy an array of dispels? As your Action, choose a Skill to use defensively and you will get +20 to defensive Tests using the Skill until the start of your next Turn.</em></p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>You can add the <strong>On the Defensive</strong> effect on the Effects tab of the character sheet, make sure to fill in whatever skill you're using inside the brackets of the effect's label.</p><p>If used often, simply disable the effect instead of deleting it to avoid remaking it each time.</p></blockquote></blockquote><h3>Attacking</h3><p>One of the most common Actions is to attack an opponent. To make a ranged attack, your weapon must be in range (see @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8]{Consumers’ Guide} for weapon ranges) and your target visible in line-of-sight. For melee attacks, you must be adjacent your target with a weapon ready (see Engaged).</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Default Combat Difficulty</em></h3><p><em>During combat, all Difficulty is assumed to be <strong>Challenging (+0)</strong>. So, if no Difficulty is expressly mentioned in the rules, use Challenging.</em></p></blockquote><h4>1: Roll to Hit</h4><p>Melee: To attack, perform an Opposed Melee Test with your Opponent (both you and your opponent Test your @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR.JournalEntryPage.mk4p8y3RetTuMe2f]{Melee Skill}). Whoever scores the highest SL wins. If you win the Test, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage. If you lose the Opposed Test, your opponent gains +1 Advantage and your Action is finished.</p><p><strong>Ranged</strong>: Roll a <strong>Ranged</strong> Test for the weapon you’re using. If you are successful, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage. If you fail, your Action is over. Your opponent doesn’t gain Advantage in ranged combat.</p><p>In both melee and ranged Combat, it’s possible to score an impressive hit called a Critical, or to make a mistake, called a Fumble. See Criticals and Fumbles in the section below.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>Test to hit your opponent with your weapon. This Test is Opposed in melee. Any winner gains +1 Advantage.</em></p><h4>2: Determine Hit Location</h4><p>If you successfully hit, find out where — reverse the roll to hit and compare this number to the Hit Locations table. So, a roll of 23 to hit would become 32 on the table, a hit on the Right Arm.</p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>To remove some of the issues with reversing hit location, a second 1d100 roll is made for the hit location.</p></blockquote><p>Creatures with different body shapes may use different hit location tables. Refer to @UUID[JournalEntry.3ZynTGhFpgwv6l1n.JournalEntryPage.UyUu4g8GQRp16paM#creature-hit-locations]{Bestiary} for more on the different Hit Location tables.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>Reverse your ‘Roll to hit’ Test result to determine a Hit Location.</em></p><h4>3: Determine Damage</h4><p>Once you have determined the hit location, it is time to work out how much Damage you deal. Each weapon has a Weapon Damage characteristic (see @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8]{Weapons}). This is usually your modified Strength Bonus for melee weapons, or a fixed number for ranged weapons. Take the SL of your Opposed Test and add it to the Weapon Damage of the weapon you’re using. This final number is your Damage.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>Damage = Weapon Damage + SL</em></p><h4>4: Apply Damage</h4><p>Using the Damage and the Hit Location you struck, you now see how many Wounds your opponent loses from your attack. Subtract your opponent’s Toughness Bonus and any Armour Points protecting the Hit Location from your Damage. The remaining Damage is suffered as Wounds by your opponent. If this is 1 or less, your opponent has shrugged off the worst of the attack and only loses 1 Wound. Should the Wounds lost exceed your opponent’s remaining Wounds total, your opponent takes a @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.WCivInLZrqEtZzF4#critical-wounds]{Critical Wound} and gains the @Condition[Prone] Condition.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>Wounds Suffered = Damage – opponent’s (Toughness Bonus + Armour Points)</em></p><p> </p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Opposing A Melee Attack</em></h3><p><em>You can Oppose an incoming melee attack with more than just your Melee Skill. The most obvious choice is Dodge, which allows you to avoid incoming blows, but @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR]{Skills and Talents} lists many other Skills that just might be useful in combat, including Intimidate, Charm, Leadership, and more. If your GM thinks it’s appropriate for the situation, and you’re happy missing out on the opportunity to score a Critical Hit against your opponent, then why not give it a go.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Engaged</h4><p>Whenever you attack an opponent, or are attacked, in melee combat, you count as Engaged. This means you are tussling with each other in a fight, and others rules (due to Talents, Spells, etc.) for being Engaged might apply. If you don’t attack each other for a full Round, you are no longer Engaged.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Success Levels in Combat</em></h3><p><em>In combat, SL is used to determine damage, rather than getting a result from the Outcome Table. To mix this up a little, Tests in combat also use Criticals and Fumbles.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Criticals and Fumbles</h3><p>During the cut and thrust of combat, accidents, mistakes, and moments of extraordinary skill can happen in quick succession. To represent the unpredictable extremes of a life-or-death skirmish, there are Criticals — extraordinarily good hits — and Fumbles — egregious errors.</p><h4>Criticals</h4><p>Any successful Melee or Ranged Test that also rolls a double causes a Critical. This means you have dealt a significant blow, and it even happens when you are the defender in an opposed Test.</p><p>If you score a Critical, your opponent receives an immediate Critical Wound as your weapon strikes true. See @UUID[.WCivInLZrqEtZzF4#critical-wounds]{Critical Wounds} for more on what this means. Beyond that, SL is calculated as normal, as is who wins any Opposed Tests.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Options: Deathblow</em></h3><p><em>Some players like a heroic approach to combat, with characters able to wade through lesser foes. If this suits your style of play, use the following rule:</em></p><p><em>If you kill a melee opponent in a single blow, you may move into the space the character occupied and attack another opponent if there is one available. You may keep doing this a number of times equal to your Weapon Skill Bonus, and may not attack the same Character more than once on the same Turn. Some creatures (see @UUID[JournalEntry.3ZynTGhFpgwv6l1n]{Bestiary}}) are so big they can activate this rule without killing any opponents.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Fumbles</h4><p>The converse of Criticals, any failed combat Test that also rolls a double is a Fumble, which means something very unfortunate has occurred. To determine what happens, roll on the @Table[oops]{Oops! Table}.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Opposed Tests and Fumbles</em></h3><p><em>During an Opposed Test, it is possible to Fumble and still win if you score a higher SL than your opponent. This is fine, and not a little hilarious, as you ineffectually tussle with your even worse opponent, potentially injuring yourself in the process.</em></p><p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Molli swipes her dagger at her opponent and rolls 66 for a fumble with -3 SL, but her opponent rolls 92 for -5 SL. So, Molli wins with +2 SL over her opponent, gaining +1 Advantage, which she may quickly lose as she also has to roll on the Oops! Table to see what unfortunate accident will befall her.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Misfires!</em></h3><p><em>If you are using a Blackpowder, Engineering, or Explosive weapon, and roll a Fumble that is also an even number — 00, 88, and so on — your weapon Misfires, exploding in your hand. You take full Damage to your Primary Arm location using the units die as an effective SL for the hit, and your weapon is destroyed.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Ranged Combat</h3><p>There are some extra considerations that apply to ranged attacks:</p><ul><li><p>Ranged attacks cannot be opposed with Melee Skills unless you have a large enough shield (see @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#shield-(rating)]{Shield}), or if they are at Point Blank range (see @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#weapon-range]{Weapon Range}), where it is also allowable to Dodge.</p></li><li><p>You cannot make ranged attacks whilst Engaged, unless you are armed with a ranged weapon that has the @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#pistol]{Pistol} Quality.</p></li><li><p>If you use your Ranged Skill when you are Engaged with your target, the target may Oppose your attack with any Melee Skill.</p></li></ul><h3>Combat Difficulty</h3><p>Combat Tests can be modified in the same manner as other Tests. These modifiers can be used to reflect the effects of terrain, the weather, and a variety of other factors. The following are some of the most common modifiers encountered in combat. For situations not covered here, use these as a guide. Remember, the GM has final say about the difficulty of any particular Test.</p><table style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Difficulty</strong></td><td><strong>Modifier</strong></td><td><p><strong>Example</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td>Very Easy</td><td>+60</td><td><p>Shooting a Monstrous target (Giant size).</p><p>Shooting into a crowd (13+ targets)</p></td></tr><tr><td>Easy</td><td>+40</td><td><p>Shooting a target at Point Blank Range (see @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#weapon-range]{Weapon Range}).</p><p>Shooting an Enormous target (Griffon size).</p><p>Attacking an opponent you outnumber 3 to 1.</p><p>Shooting at a Large group (7–12 targets).</p></td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>+20</td><td><p>Shooting a Large target (Ogre size).</p><p>Shooting at Short Range: less than half weapon range.</p><p>Shooting at a small group (3–6 targets)</p><p>Shooting when you spent your last Action aiming (no Test to aim required).</p><p>Attacking an Engaged opponent in the sides or rear.</p><p>Attacking an opponent you outnumber 2 to 1.</p><p>Attacking a target with the @Condition[Prone] Condition.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Challenging</td><td>+0</td><td><p>A standard attack.</p><p>Shooting an Average target (Human size).</p></td></tr><tr><td>Difficult</td><td>–10</td><td><p>Attacking whilst you have the @Condition[Prone] Condition, or otherwise beneath your target.</p><p>Attacking whilst in the mud, heavy rain or difficult terrain.</p><p>Shooting at Long Range: up to double weapon range.</p><p>Shooting on a Round where you also use your Move.</p><p>Shooting a small target (Child size).</p><p>Target in soft cover (behind a hedge for example).</p></td></tr><tr><td>Hard</td><td>–20</td><td><p>A called shot to a specific Hit Location.

Lurking in a gloomy forest as you attempt to shoot at a distant opponent through the trees is harder than shooting at the same opponent on a bright day in an open field. When combining multiple difficulties, use the following guidelines:</em></p><ul><li><p><em>If the situation would apply two or more penalties, simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of –30 or Very Hard. For example, fog and aiming for a specific body part both make Weapon Skill Tests <strong>Hard (–20)</strong>. When combined, the Test would simply be <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong>, rather than suffer a –40 modifier. Similarly, if the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the modifiers together to a maximum of +60 or Very Easy.</em></p></li><li><p><em>If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add them together to find the new difficulty. Attacking an opponent while standing in deep snow normally requires a <strong>Very Hard (–30)</strong> Test. But attacking an opponent who is Prone requires an <strong>Easy (+20)</strong> Test. In a situation where both apply, the Test would be <strong>Difficult (–10)</strong> since –30 plus +20 equals –10.</em></p></li></ul><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Options: Shooting Into Melee</em></h3><p><em>For most, simply choosing a target and rolling to hit is enough of a complication. However, some prefer the rules be more precise when firing at an Engaged target. If this is you, use the following rules:</em></p><p><em>Ballistic Skill Tests against Engaged opponents are resolved as normal, but suffer a penalty of –20 as you try your best to hit your specified target. If this modifier causes you to fail when the Test would otherwise have succeeded, you instead hit one of the target’s Engaged opponents, as determined randomly by the GM. If you do not care whom you hit, you may gain a bonus of +20 to +60 to hit, see <strong>Shooting into a Group</strong> below.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Helpless Targets</h4><p>Melee Tests made to hit a sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise helpless target automatically succeed. Check the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition for more on this.</p><h4>Shooting into a Group</h4><p>Ranged Tests made to hit a group of targets are <strong>Average (+20)</strong> if there is 3-6 of them, <strong>Easy (+40)</strong> if there are 7-12 of them, and <strong>Very Easy (+60)</strong> if there is 13 or more of them. Any successful hits are randomised between all likely targets as the GM prefers. If this modifier allows you to hit when the Test would otherwise have failed, you succeed with +0 SL.</p><h4>Outnumbering</h4><p>If you out-number an opponent 2 to 1, you gain a bonus of +20 to hit your opponent in melee combat. If you outnumber an enemy by 3 to 1, you get an even larger bonus of +40 to hit. Further, at the end of every Round, all outnumbered opponents lose 1 Advantage. Outnumbering is generally determined by how many Characters are Engaged with each other; if there is any doubt, the GM decides who is outnumbering whom.</p><h4>Size</h4><p>Size is an important factor when shooting at a target: it is far easier to hit a barn door than an apple. For more on Size, refer to .

The following applies when you are fighting with two weapons. </p><ul><li><p>You may use any one-handed close combat weapon or any pistol when fighting with two weapons.</p></li><li><p>You may use either hand to make an attack. Attacks made using your secondary hand suffer  a –20  penalty to any applicable Test.</p></li><li><p>If you have the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.URwIDtInCsxOoGqM]{Dual Wielder} Talent you may be able to attack with both weapons.</p></li></ul><h3>Scatter</h3><p>On a failed <strong>Ranged (Throwing)</strong> Test, roll on the @Table[scatter]{Scatter Table} to see where your weapon lands. ‘T’ marks the target.</p><p>A roll of 1-8 provides a direction: roll [[/r 2d10]] to determine the distance the weapon scatters in yards — it scatters no more than half the distance between you and the target. A roll of 9 and the weapon lands at your feet. A 10, and it lands at your target’s feet. Scatter can be used whenever a random direction is required.</p><h3>Unarmed Combat</h3><p>Not every fight in <strong>WFRP</strong>  involves  guns or swords. Many  conflicts are settled with good, old-fashioned  fisticuffs. A successful Melee (Brawling) Test for unarmed combat is handled in the same way as any other combat Test, but you have one extra option: you may enter a Grapple!</p><h4>Grappling</h4><p>Instead of inflicting damage with an unarmed attack, you can attempt to Grapple and  immobilise your opponent. You must declare this is your intent before rolling to hit your opponent. If you win the Opposed Test, you and your opponent are Grappling, and your opponent gains the @Condition[Entangled] Condition. If you begin your turn Grappling, you may break the Grapple if you have a higher Advantage than your opponent, and do not count as being Engaged for your Move; otherwise, you must make an <strong>Opposed Strength</strong> Test for your Action. If you win, you can do one of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Deal SB + SL Damage using your Strength roll to determine the Hit Location affected. You ignore any Armour Points as you wrench arms and pull muscles.</p></li><li><p>Either:</p><ol><li><p>Give your opponent an @Condition[Entangled] Condition, or</p></li><li><p>Remove an @Condition[Entangled] Condition from yourself, plus lose an extra one for each SL by which you win.</p></li></ol></li></ul><p>If you lose the Opposed Test, you can do nothing but struggle as your opponent gains +1 Advantage.</p><p>Those outside the Grapple gain a +20 bonus to hit the grapplers with the lowest Advantage, and a +10 bonus to hit to the grappler with the highest Advantage. </p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Options: Grappling With Skills</em></h3><p><em>If you are Grappling, your GM may allow you to perform a Test other than an Opposed Strength Test according to the situation. Perhaps Language (Magick) to cast a spell, or Charm to wheedle your way free, or Leadership to order your grappler to stand down? As long as your GM is happy with this, roll those dice and see what happens. But if you fail, note that you will not be concentrating on the Grapple, so the GM may rule you gain an extra @Condition[Entangled] Condition, which could make things very tricky!</em></p></blockquote><h3>Mounted Combat</h3><p>Riding into Combat, sword swinging, guns blazing, is not only terrifying for those on the receiving end, it also brings bonuses to the rider. Mounted Combat uses the same rules as any other Combat, with the following additions:</p><ul><li><p>For the purposes of your Move, riders count as having the Movement Attribute of their mount. Further, riders take Ride Tests for any tests to Run, Jump or similar, and use their mount’s Movement Attribute.</p></li><li><p>Any melee attack from a Rider on a target smaller than their Mount gains a bonus of +20 to hit.</p></li><li><p>If you are rolling to hit a mounted character, you choose whether to hit the rider or the mount. If you are in close combat, you also suffer a penalty of –10 to your Melee Test if you target the rider and are smaller than the mount (see @UUID[.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#size]{Size}).</p></li><li><p>A Mount without the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.IPKRMGry6WotuS1G]{Skittish} Trait is effectively another combatant, and may use its own Action to attack Engaged targets.</p></li><li><p>When Charging, you may use the Strength and Size rules of your mount for the purposes of calculating Damage.</p></li><li><p>When riding, you suffer a penalty of –20 to any attempts to use the Dodge Skill unless you have the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.FjTnaxixsu1ShNNr]{Trick Riding} Talent.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: Most mounts are bigger than Characters, meaning they may cause Fear or Terror, and gain other combat advantages as explained on @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size}.</p><h3>Advantage</h3><p>Advantage represents your momentum in combat, and is gained when you outwit, defeat, or otherwise dominate your opponents. It is recorded with tokens — be these coins, cards, chits, counters, or specially designed Advantage tokens — or by a tally sheet on scrap paper.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase;text-align:center\"><em>Options: Limiting Advantage</em></h3><p><em>Some GMs prefer a more controlled combat environment that isn’t so influenced by the whimsy of dice and luck. As Advantage can swing wildly during the course of a battle, and can have a significant impact, consider using one of the following optional rules if you wish to contain this:</em></p><ul><li><p><em>Advantage has an upper level equal to each Character’s Initiative Bonus.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Cap Advantage at a pre-arranged limit, such as 2, 4, or more. 10 also works well as you can easily track it with 1d10.</em></p></li></ul></blockquote><h4>Gaining Advantage</h4><p>Advantage is secured each time you win an Opposed Test in combat, you assess the battlefield using your Skills, or when your spirits are lifted. The following provides some examples of this, but is far from exhaustive, and the GM is encouraged to hand out Advantage tokens as suits the circumstances.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Surprise</strong>: Attacking @Condition[Surprised] enemies brings +1 Advantage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charging</strong>: @UUID[.bdfiyhEYtKs7irqc#charging]{Charging} headlong into combat grants +1 Advantage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assess</strong>: If you use one of your Skills to secure a tactical advantage, gain +1 Advantage. See individual Skill descriptions in @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR]{Skills and Talents} for more details concerning this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Victory</strong>: Whenever you defeat an important NPC, gain +1 Advantage. Subduing a party nemesis may grant +2 Advantage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Winning</strong>: If you win an Opposed Test during combat gain +1 Advantage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Outmanouevre</strong>: If you wound an opponent without engaging in an Opposed Test, gain +1 Advantage.</p></li></ul><p>There is also an array of Talents that secure Advantage. Refer to @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR]{Skills and Talents} for more on this.</p><h4>Benefits of Advantage</h4><p>Each Advantage you secure adds +10 to any appropriate combat Test or @UUID[.5w5YLPNd6AaU4f85#psychology-test]{Psychology Test}. Thus, if you have 5 Advantage tokens, you have an impressive +50 bonus to hit, defend, and resist the influence of others.</p><h4>Losing Advantage</h4><p>If you lose an Opposed Test during combat, suffer any @UUID[.SjuV1vgbgM49pFpP]{Conditions}, or lose any Wounds, you automatically lose all Advantage. Further, should the combat end, all Advantage you’ve gained is lost. Lastly, if you have accrued no Advantage for the Round, or end the Round outnumbered, you lose 1 point. Advantage can also be used to @UUID[.bdfiyhEYtKs7irqc#disengaging]{Disengage} from combat. There are also Skills and Talents that cause you to lose Advantage, or transfer Advantage to another character. For more on these, read @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR]{Skills and Talents}.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"name":"Moving","type":"text","_id":"bdfiyhEYtKs7irqc","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/hat-fight.webp\" width=\"172\" height=\"236\" /></div><p>The amount of detail needed for movement depends on how you track where everyone is. Many prefer to use the ‘theatre of the mind’ method, where you describe relative positions and distance, and the GM adjudicates if it’s possible to undertake the Move or Action each player describes. Even during tightly controlled combat Rounds, it is usually enough to narrate how your character negotiates the frenetic action, leaping barrels, sprinting for cover, or dancing around opponents as required.</p><p>Other groups use floorplans, grids, tokens, and Citadel Miniatures to represent where the combatants are standing, and this method needs a bit more specific information on distance and movement. If you do this, we recommend a 1-inch grid, with each square representing a distance of 2 yards in the game world. This means if you have Movement 4, you can normally move 4 squares. Humans, Mutants, and other similarly-sized creatures occupy a single square on the map. Larger creatures can take up 2, 4, or even more squares, according to their @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size} trait. If you prefer to go gridless, keep the 1 Movement = 2 yards scale.</p><h3>Moving During Combat</h3><p>The Movement Table shows how many yards you can normally move in a single Turn, either Walking or Running, without having to make an Athletics Test to sprint. Doing this will use your Move for your Turn.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Movement</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Walk (yards)</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Run (yards)</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">6</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">12</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">16</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">5</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">20</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">6</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">12</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">24</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">7</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">14</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">28</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">8</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">16</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">32</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">9</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">18</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">36</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">10</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">20</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">40</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Charging</h4><p>If you are not Engaged in combat already, you can use your Move to Charge. If you Charge, your Action must be a Melee Test to attack an opponent. If your opponent is at least your Move characteristic in yards away before you Charge, but within your Run range (see the Run entry in the Movement Table for how far you can move when Charging), you will also gain +1 Advantage as you barrel into your opponent.</p><h4>Disengaging</h4><p>If you are @UUID[.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#engaged]{Engaged} in combat, and no longer wish to be trading blows with your opponent, you have the following two options for leaving combat safely.</p><p><strong>Use Advantage</strong>: If you have more Advantage than your opponents, you are in a superior position and can easily manoeuvre yourself beyond reach. If you choose to drop your Advantage to 0, you can move away from your opponents without penalty, perhaps choosing to Charge a new target, run away as fast as possible, or backstep a little and fire a pistol in an opponent’s face!</p><p>Use Dodge: If you have lower or equal Advantage to your opponents or do not wish to spend your Advantage, you are pinned in place. If you wish to escape, you will need to use your Action to make an <strong>Opposed Dodge/Melee</strong> Test. If you succeed, you gain +1 Advantage, and can use your Move to go anywhere you wish using the normal rules. If you fail, each opponent defeating you gains +1 Advantage and makes it impossible for you to escape without a blow to your back.</p><h4>Fleeing</h4><p>If you cannot escape otherwise, you can turn your back and flee as your Move. Often, Fleeing is involuntary, caused by @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.psychologies.meMkLEwdJIDLxM0B]{Terror} or magic.</p><p>If you flee, your opponent immediately gains 1 Advantage and may attempt 1 free attack. The free attack is an unopposed Melee Test using whatever weapon is currently held, using the SL scored to Damage you as normal. As you are throwing caution to the wind, your opponent gains +20 to hit you. If you are hit, your opponent gains +1 Advantage, and you must enact a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test: if failed, gain a @Condition[Broken] Condition, and a further +1 Broken condition per SL below 0. Once the free attack is concluded, you may move up to your Run Movement (see the Movement Table) directly away from your opponent, assuming you still can.</p><h4>Running</h4><p>On your turn, you can use your Action to sprint. This requires an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test, and the distance covered is in addition to your Move this round. You sprint your Run movement + SL in yards (see the Movement Table for your Run movement). So, a character with Move 4 who rolled –2 SL would sprint an additional 14 yards (16–2=14).</p><h4>Climbing</h4><p>Most climb moves won’t need Tests. Climbing rules are only required when the Climb is difficult or if knowing exactly how long you take to ascend is important.</p><p>Climbing a ladder or similarly easy-to-climb surface does not require a Test but does slow you down. You move at half rate up or down ladders or other easily climbed surfaces. So, it would cost 4 yards of your Movement to climb a 2-yard ladder. If you want to climb more quickly, spend your Action to make an <strong>Average (+20) Climb</strong> Test. You will Climb an extra Movement + SL yards. So, a character with Movement 4 who rolled +2 SL will climb an additional 6 yards (4+2=6).</p><p>If both hands are free, you can climb a surface with suitable handholds with a Climb Test using your Action for the turn. You ascend or descend at a rate of ½ Movement + SL in yards.</p><p>Climbing difficulty is set by the GM and varies with the nature of the climbed surface. Some climbs will be beyond the ability of most characters without the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.MGEPI4jNhymNIRVz]{Scale Sheer Surface} Talent.</p><h3>Leaping and Falling</h3><p>Jumping to reach high ledges, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, or failing both and plummeting to your death are all essential parts of the <strong>WFRP</strong> experience.</p><p>Simple Athletics Tests, or perhaps a Perform (Acrobatics) Test, will be enough to determine the outcome on most occasions, but sometimes knowing exactly how high you jump, how far you leap, or what happens when you fall is useful.</p><h4>Leaping</h4><p>You can leap your Movement in feet without having to make a Test. If you want to jump farther, this takes an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test if you have a run up of at least your Movement in yards; if you do not, the Test is <strong>Challenging (+0).</strong> On a success, each SL adds an extra foot to the leap. If you succeeded with +0 SL, you manage an extra 6 inches with your jump.</p><h4>Falling</h4><p>When falling, you suffer [[/r 1d10 # Fall Damage]] Damage, plus 3 Damage for every yard you fall. Any suffered Damage is reduced by your Toughness Bonus, but not any Armour Points you may be wearing.</p><p>If you are purposefully falling — or, if you prefer, jumping downwards — you can attempt an <strong>Average (+20) Athletics</strong> Test to lessen the damage you may sustain. If successful, you count as having fallen 1 less yard, plus an extra yard less per SL scored.</p><p>If you reduce the distance you count as having fallen to 0 or less, you will suffer no Damage from the fall.</p><p>If more Wounds are suffered from a fall than your Toughness Bonus, you also gain the @Condition[Prone] Condition.</p><h3>Pursuit</h3><p>Desperate chase scenes through busy markets and high-speed pursuits hanging from the back of careening coaches are the centrepiece of many exciting adventures. Here’s how to run a pursuit:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Determine Distance</strong> — The GM decides how far ahead the pursued are from the pursuers, and assigns a number to represent the size of the head start, called the Distance. Typically, this will range from 1 for those almost in reach, to 4 for those with a good lead, to 8 for those almost beyond reach when the pursuit begins.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test</strong> — Everyone actively moving in the pursuit rolls a Test for their movement — typically this will be a Drive, Ride, or Athletics Test depending upon the circumstances.</p></li><li><p><strong>Update Distance</strong> — The lowest SL of the pursued and the highest SL of the pursuers is compared, the difference between these is added to the Distance if the pursued won, and subtracted from the Distance number if the pursuers won.</p></li><li><p><strong>Determine Outcome</strong> — If the Distance falls to 0 or less, the pursuers have caught their quarry! The pursued can then sacrifice their slowest member that Round to delay the pursuers as the rest continue to flee, or they can stop and confront their pursuers. If the slowest of the pursued is abandoned, the pursuers decide who stops to confront the unfortunate and who continues in pursuit. If the poor abandoned runner is not a priority target it’s quite likely the pursuers will continue their pursuit of their target. If Distance reaches 10+, the pursuers have lost their quarry and the pursuit is over… for now! If the Distance is still 1–9, the pursuit continues, return to step 2.</p></li></ol><p>As each Round passes, it’s important to describe what just happened in a fun and exciting fashion. If you score a large SL, describe people getting out of the way, giving you an opportunity to make ground. If you score a negative SL, describe tripping over crates, running into people, or slamming your coach against a wall, slowing you down.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Eichengard and Sigrid are chasing three cultists through the streets of Altdorf. The cultists got a decent head start, so the GM gives him a lead of Distance 2. Each character rolls an Athletics Test to start the pursuit. Sigrid scores +3 SL; the cultists score +0, +2, and +2 SL; and Eichengard scores +2 SL.</em></p><p><em>So, after the first round, the difference between the slowest cultist (0) and the fastest pursuing character (Sigrid with 3) is 3, meaning that the characters catch up with the cultists. The cowardly cultists abandon their slowest member in the hope of saving their hides, and Sigrid stops to subdue the abandoned aberrant.</em></p><p><em>Next round the cultists start at a Distance of 1 (the difference between the next slowest cultist and Sigrid last round) so Eichengard just needs to beat them by +1 SL to catch up again.</em></p><h4>Movement Modifiers</h4><p>If some of the characters in the pursuit have a higher Movement, they gain a bonus SL equal to the difference in Movement. So, if you had Move 5 and you were chasing a Move 4 character, you would gain +1 SL on your pursuit roll.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Perdita is urging her horse forwards, trying to chase down two Bandits. Her horse has Movement 8, where the Bandits are on Movement 7 and Movement 9 horses. Thus, the first Bandit has an unmodified Test, Perdita gains a bonus of +1 SL, and the second Bandit gains a bonus of +2 SL when they all roll their Ride (Horse) Tests.</em></p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Options: Chase Compilcation</em></h3><p><em>The Pursuit rules are more than enough for a fast, fun chase scene. However, for those looking to add more detail, consider the following two options, and embellish them as required.</em></p><p><em><strong>Dodge that!</strong>: Each round, the character who rolled the highest SL can create an Obstacle. An Obstacle could be pulling a pile of barrels into the path of a pursuer, or perhaps calling out for help to catch someone running away. The winner chooses one Character: that Character suffers a penalty of –1 SL next round as they have to deal with the Obstacle. Make sure to take time to describe exactly what has happened to keep the chase entertaining.</em></p><p><em><strong>Consider the Environment</strong>: Perhaps there is a bridge coming up? Or a gap to jump? Or a fence to leap over? Or a city gate to pass through? The GM can throw in different Tests as the Rounds progress, mixing up the requirement each round. So, Round 1 may need an Athletics Test as everyone runs, Round 2 may require a Leadership or Intimidate Test to pass through a guarded gate, Round 3 may need another Athletics Test to jump a small stream, and Round 4 may be sprint across an open field (modified by Movement again).</em></p></blockquote>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":400000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"name":"Conditions","type":"text","_id":"SjuV1vgbgM49pFpP","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Conditions represent the effects of things that can happen to you in the course of your adventures.

When you do this, choose one of the following two options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Die Another Day</strong>:  Instead of dying, your character is knocked out, left for dead, swept away by a river, or otherwise taken out of action; your character will survive, no matter the fatal incident’s circumstances, but takes no further part in the current encounter.</p></li><li><p><strong>How Did That Miss?</strong>:  Your character completely avoids the incoming damage by some extraordinary fluke, such as slipping just as a blow is about to connect, a weapon mysteriously jamming, or an unexpected source of light blinding an opponent; your character can continue on without penalty, but has no guarantee of survival in later rounds.</p></li></ul><p>The first option takes you out of play, but allows you to fight another day, for all your character may be battered, bloody, bruised, and perhaps even captured in the process! The second option allows you to continue fighting side-by-side with your companions, but leaves you in significant danger, meaning you may need to spend more Fate points in later Rounds to ensure survival. Each option has advantages and disadvantages, depending upon the context of the situation, and it is up to you to decide which is the best choice to take.</p><p>The GM describes how you survive a given situation after spending a Fate rating point.</p><h4>Regaining Fate and Fortune</h4><p>You regain all Fortune points at the start of every gaming session, up to the maximum of your current Fate. In addition, certain in-game encounters may also replenish (or remove!) Fortune points.</p><p>Your GM may grant you a Fate point for an act of extreme heroism, bravery, or significance. Normally this only happens at the successful end of an important adventure, so make sure to spend them carefully as they rarely replenish.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Long Gaming Sessions</em></h3><p><em>Some players prefer short sessions of a few hours, others prefer day-long marathons. If your group prefers longer sessions, replenish Fortune points at narratively appropriate moments, roughly every four hours.</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/bon-voyage.webp\" /></div><h3>Resilience and Resolve</h3><p>While Fate points represent your destiny, perhaps chosen by some distant, uncaring deity, Resilience is an indication of your personal drive and determination to endure, and overcome, no matter the obstacles you face.</p><p>Like Fate, Resilience is directly linked to a pool of points, this time called Resolve. Resolve points are spent to push through minor obstacles, such as ignoring the negative effects of critical wounds for a Round or removing Conditions. Resilience determines your upper limit of Resolve points and can be permanently spent to push yourself through seemingly impossible situations.</p><h4>Spending Resolve</h4><p>You may spend a Resolve point to draw upon your inner reserves: maybe confronting a terrifying Ogre without flinching; or ignoring the effects of even the most powerful of blows. Your choices are:</p><ul><li><p>Become immune to Psychology until the end of the next round. See @UUID[.5w5YLPNd6AaU4f85]{Psychology}.</p></li><li><p>Ignore all modifiers from all Critical Wounds until the beginning of the next round.</p></li><li><p>Remove one Condition; if you removed the @Condition[Prone] Condition, regain 1 Wound as you surge to your feet.</p></li></ul><h4>Spending Resilience</h4><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/spot-skull-helmet.webp\" width=\"166\" height=\"181\" /></div><p>You may also choose to spend Resilience point to defy the corruption curling  within, or to succeed where it would seem certain you should fail. Here, you have the following two options:</p><ul><li><p><strong>I Deny You!</strong>:  You may choose not to develop a rolled mutation. Because you do not mutate, you do not lose any Corruption points. See @UUID[.115GzWrmkD4viyy5]{Corruption} for more on this.</p></li><li><p><strong>I Will Not Fail!</strong>: Rather than roll the result of a Test, you choose the number instead, allowing you to succeed in even the direst of situations. In an Opposed Test, you always win by at least 1 SL. If you cause a Critical, you can choose the Hit Location struck rather than randomising it. You can even choose to do this on a Test already failed.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>A bandit leader is on the rampage, having built up 10 Advantage while evading the party’s blows. Things are about to get messy! Salundra decides to attack the bandit, but loses the Opposed Test by 7 SL, which is going to hurt a lot. So, she spends a permanent Resilience point to invoke ‘I Will Not Fail’. This means she automatically wins the Opposed Test by +1 SL. She also chooses the result of the roll to be 11, causing a Critical. The bandit leader will take some Wounds and a Critical Wound. More importantly, his rampage comes to an end as he also loses all 10 Advantage as the fight turns in the heroes favour.</em></p><p>Saving permanent Resilience to rebuff the influence of Chaos is wise, but it does not remove your Corruption points, meaning mutation is still perilously close. By comparison, using permanent Resilience to succeed in any Test can allow you to land a blow on an otherwise impossible-to-hit target, create an artefact that astounds all who see it with a Trade skill, or even perfectly manifest a spell you would normally find impossible to cast.</p><p>When you spend a Resilience point, take time to describe the enormous feat of will your character has undertaken, and how this manifests in play.</p><h4>Regaining Resilience and Resolve</h4><p>Resolve is regained whenever you act according to your @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.GaZa9sU4KjKDswMr#determining-motivation]{Motivation}. During play, whenever you feel you have done this, you may ask the GM if you can recover one or more Resolve points.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Griselda is a nun with the Motivation ‘Sigmar’. While her allies gossip in a tavern seeking clues, she elects to visit the local temple to make a donation and offer prayers to her deity. As this fits her Motivation, her GM decides to replenish one of her Resolve points but tells Griselda’s player that she will need to pray and donate in a different temple to receive that benefit again this week.</em></p><p>The GM may grant a Resilience point for an act of extreme importance to your Motivation, permanently nourishing your soul, but such an event will be very rare.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>After many adventures, Griselda finally finances a new temple to Sigmar in her home village of Velten not far from Nuln. The GM recognises the importance of this to Griselda’s faith and grants her a permanent Resilience point.</em></p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/elf-on-a-shelf.webp\" width=\"270\" height=\"311\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":600000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"name":"Injury","type":"text","_id":"WCivInLZrqEtZzF4","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Almost all characters will suffer injuries during the course of play. The injury rules show you how to deal with them and how to heal them, when possible.</p><h3>Wounds, Critical Wounds, and Death</h3><p>Wound loss represents minor cuts and abrasions, bruises and bashes, and even the depletion of spiritual and mental energy reserves. By comparison, Critical Wounds are much more severe, expressing serious injuries, broken bones, torn muscles, and ripped flesh. Gain too many Critical Wounds, and you risk death.</p><h4>Wounds</h4><p>Wounds are lost by sustaining Damage. Each time you suffer a point of Damage, you lose 1 Wound. So, if you suffer 8 points of Damage, you lose 8 Wounds. Often, especially in combat, your Toughness Bonus or Armour Points may reduce suffered Damage.</p><p>So, if you were hit in the arm for 10 Damage and your Toughness Bonus was 3, and you had leather armour on that arm for 1 Armour Point, you would suffer 6 Wounds (10–3–1=6). The rules will tell you when you can or cannot reduce Damage with Toughness and Armour Points.</p><p>If you lose all of your Wounds, your collected injuries overwhelm you, and you gain the @Condition[Prone] Condition. Until you heal at least 1 Wound, you cannot lose the Prone Condition; worse, if you’re not healed within a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus, you will pass out, gaining the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition. You will not regain consciousness until you heal back at least 1 Wound (see @UUID[.WCivInLZrqEtZzF4#healing]{Healing}).</p><p>If you take enough Damage that you would be taken to negative Wounds — say you suffered 5 Damage when you only had 2 Wounds left — you suffer a Critical Wound. If you suffer fewer negative Wounds than your Toughness Bonus (so, fewer than –4 Wounds if your Toughness Bonus is 4), you subtract –20 from your Critical Table result, with a minimum result of 01. Note: You never actually go into negative Wounds. The lowest number of Wounds you can ever have is 0.</p><h4>Critical Wounds</h4><p>Critical Wounds are most commonly suffered in combat when something <em>really</em> wants to hurt you. The two most frequent sources of Critical Wounds are when a Critical Hit is scored, or when you lose more Wounds than you have (see @UUID[.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#criticals-and-fumbles]{Combat} for more on how Critical Hits happens).</p><p>Each Critical Wound you receive will impact your ability to function in a different way. To determine what effects a Critical Wound has, refer to the Critical Tables.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 class=\"sidebar-title\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Pulling Your Blows</em></h4><p><em>The rules assume you wish to inflict every possible Critical Wound you can. However, it’s also possible you may just want to subdue, not kill, your opponents. Or you may be sparring. With that in mind, you may ignore any Critical Hit you should inflict upon your opponents if you declare you are ‘pulling your blow’ before you roll to hit. If you do this, make sure you describe the situation appropriately, making it clear you’re using the flat of your blade or otherwise doing what you can to avoid properly hurting your opponent.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Death</h4><p>If you take the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition and have 0 Wounds, compare the total number of Critical Wounds you currently suffer with your Toughness Bonus. If you have more Critical Wounds than your Toughness Bonus, you succumb to your horrific wounds and will die at the end of the round unless, by some miracle, someone heals one of your Critical Wounds.</p><p>Also, if you have the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition, anyone attacking you with suitable weapons can kill you, should they wish.</p><p>Though, in the thick of combat, those lying apparently dead on the floor are almost always ignored in favour of combatants still standing.</p><p>Lastly, a few results sourced from the Critical Tables can result in death.

But some are worse than others. The following explains how to heal Wounds and Critical Wounds.</p><h4>Healing Wounds</h4><p>You are considered wounded if you have lost any of your Wounds.</p><p>Without medical attention, you can attempt an <strong>Average (+20) Endurance</strong> Test after a good sleep once a day. You Heal Wounds equal to the SL + your Toughness Bonus. For each day you spend taking it easy, you also heal an extra number of Wounds equal to your Toughness Bonus.</p><p>If you wish to Heal more Wounds than this, then you need to be attended by someone with the @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR.JournalEntryPage.dSf8QWBvN6mlpHBF]{Heal} skill or you’ll need @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.trappings.1wtW4N8l3UKwlLI3]{bandages}, a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.trappings.s2lBWQFQt6M5Pngb]{healing poultice}, or similar (see @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.PYiffieXenZHBUAU]{Consumers’ Guide}).</p><p>There is no penalty for being wounded. Lost Wounds are considered to be small cuts, bruises, and other easily ignored injuries.</p><h4>Healing Critical Wounds</h4><p>If you have received any Critical Wounds, you are said to be Critically Wounded. Critical Wounds can be very serious. Refer to the appropriate @UUID[.WCivInLZrqEtZzF4#critical-tables]{Critical Table} to see exactly what penalties you suffer for any Critical Wounds sustained. Critical Wounds do not count as healed until all conditions they inflict are removed, and all non-permanent negative modifiers are resolved. When you are Critically Wounded, you may still heal your Wounds using the normal rules.</p><h3>Medical Attention</h3><p>Several Critical Wound results and conditions cannot be resolved until you receive medical attention. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p><ul><li><p>Successful use of the Heal skill.</p></li><li><p>Application of a bandage, healing poultice, or similar.</p></li><li><p>Successful use of a spell or prayer that heals Wounds.</p></li></ul><h4>Surgery</h4><p>Some wounds are beyond simple stitching and foul-smelling poultices. If you suffer a Critical Wound where surgery is required to attend to it (it will be marked: Surgery), you suffer the marked penalties until you visit an appropriately trained doctor or barber-surgeon, or somehow source a magical or divine surgery equivalent.</p><p>Further, if you suffer an amputated body part, you cannot heal 1 of the suffered Wounds until a surgeon successfully treats it with a Heal Test. For more information on surgery, refer to the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.NP4EHyyh1yOLbsPU]{Surgery}.</p><h3>Other Damage</h3><p>The Old World is a dangerous place, hiding countless ways to die. The following covers some of the more common other ways you can receive Damage during play.</p><h4>Drowning and Suffocation</h4><p>If prepared, you can hold your breath for Toughness Bonus x 10 seconds without a Test. After that, you may start to suffocate or drown. If you are unprepared and suddenly deprived of air, you will start to suffocate immediately.</p><p>Each Round you are being suffocated you lose 1 Wound. Should you reach 0 Wounds, you immediately receive the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition. After that, you will die of suffocation or drowning in Toughness Bonus Rounds.</p><h4>Exposure</h4><p>Every 4 hours spent in a difficult environment — such as sub-zero temperatures, a hot desert, or a howling storm — requires you take an Endurance Test. Extreme environments require a Test every 2 hours.</p><p><strong>Cold</strong>: Your first failure causes a penalty of –10 Ballistic Skill, Agility and Dexterity. The second failure reduces all other Characteristics by –10. Third and subsequent failures cause [[/r 1d10 # Damage]] Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost. If you reach zero Wounds, you immediately take an @Condition[Unconscious] condition. Certain Trappings provide bonuses and penalties to these Tests. See @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.uQM0LRp5pm5i5dX8]{Clothing and Accessories} and @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.fiXbxW3H96StJWmH]{Miscellaneous Trappings}.</p><p><strong>Heat</strong>: Your first failure causes a penalty of –10 to Intelligence and Willpower, and adds a @Condition[Fatigued] Condition. The second failure reduces all other Characteristics by –10%, and adds another Fatigued Condition. Third and subsequent failures cause [[/r 1d10 # Damage]] Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost. Stripping off heavy Trappings cancels 1 failed test.</p><h4>Thirst and Starvation</h4><p>Running out of provisions can be bad. Running out of water is worse. Endurance Tests to withstand thirst and hunger become increasingly difficult (cumulative –10 for every test). Characters without food and water cannot heal Wounds or recover Fatigue naturally.</p><p><strong>Water</strong>: Every day without water requires you make an Endurance test. The first failed Test causes a penalty of –10 Intelligence, Willpower, and Fellowship. Second and subsequent failures reduce all Characteristics by –10 and cause [[/r 1d10 # Damage]] Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost.</p><p><strong>Food</strong>: Every 2 days without food require an Endurance Test. The first failed Tests causes a penalty of –10 Strength and Toughness. Second and subsequent failures reduce all other Characteristics by –10 and cause [[/r 1d10 # Damage]] Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":700000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"name":"Corruption","type":"text","_id":"115GzWrmkD4viyy5","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Every Festag, Sigmarite priests preach from high pulpits about the dangers of the Ruinous Powers, about how good folk must avoid the temptations of daemons whispering from every shadow.

Think of the Test tied to the dark deed, and then consider soul-staining events that could occur to ensure your success.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Corrupting Influences</h4>\n<p>Corruption points are usually gained by exposure to a place, person, or object tainted by Chaos, or to a situation especially beloved to one of the Dark Gods.</p>\n<p>If you encounter a corrupting influence, attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test, or <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test, as determined by the GM — usually physical influences are resisted with Endurance, spiritual corruption is resisted with Cool.</p>\n<p>The stronger the corrupting influence, the more SL you will need to avoid it. The following provides some examples of corrupting influences with the number of SL needed to completely avoid Corruption points.</p>\n<h4>@Corruption[minor]{Minor Exposure}</h4>\n<p>These corrupting influences, although relatively trivial, still endanger a weak soul. If a Test is failed to resist such a minor exposure, gain 1 Corruption point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Witness a Lesser Daemon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact with a Mutant, refined Warpstone, or Chaos-tainted artefact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Giving in to despair, rage, excess, or the need to change your lot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being near Warpstone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prolonged exposure to Chaos worshippers, Chaos Cult Temples, Skaven, Mutant Lairs, and similar.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>@Corruption[moderate]{Moderate Exposure}</h4>\n<p>Moderate corrupting influences are a danger to every soul and should be avoided under all circumstances. If a Test is failed, gain 2 Corruption points. On a Marginal Success (0–1), gain 1 Corruption point. On a Success (2+), you gain no Corruption points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Witness multiple Daemons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact with a Daemon, Warpstone, or profane artefact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Embracing despair, rage, excess, or the desire to become someone new.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prolonged exposure to refined Warpstone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Brief exposure to an environment steeped with <em>Dhar</em>, dark magic used by Necromancers and Chaos Sorcerers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>@Corruption[major]{Major Exposure}</h4>\n<p>If you find yourself confronted with a major corrupting influence, flee. Stay for too long, and you may never be the same again. For each failed Test to resist a major exposure, gain 3 Corruption points. If you pass with a Marginal Success (0–1), gain 2 Corruption points. On a Success (2–3), you gain 1 Corruption point. Only if you score an Impressive Success (4+), do you gain no Corruption points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Witness a Greater Daemon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prolonged contact with a Daemon, Warpstone, or profane artefact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Making a deal with a Daemon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consuming refined Warpstone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prolonged exposure to an environment steeped with <em>dhar</em> (see @UUID[JournalEntry.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f]{Magic} for more on this).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/spot-book.webp\" width=\"191\" height=\"232\" /></div>\n<h3>Corrupting</h3>\n<p>No-one is left unscathed by exposure to the Ruinous Powers. Eventually, even the strongest fall, their mind and bodies twisting into new unrecognisable forms.</p>\n<p>Should you ever gain more Corruption points than your Willpower Bonus plus your Toughness Bonus, immediately attempt a <strong>Challenging (+0) Endurance</strong> Test. If passed, you have managed to hold off your corruption for now but will have to Test again next time you gain Corruption Points. If you fail, then either your body or mind is about to mutate.</p>\n<h4>Dissolution of Body and Mind</h4>\n<p>As corruption ravages your soul, the warping breath of Chaos whispers within, either fanning your flesh into a fresh, new form, or fracturing your psyche with exquisite knowledge it can never unlearn.</p>\n<p>First, lose Corruption points equal to your Willpower Bonus as you mutate. Next, roll on the @Table[corruption]{Dissolution of Body and Mind} table to determine whether it’s your body or your mind that blossoms anew.</p>\n<p>Now roll on either the @Table[mutatephys]{Physical Corruption Table} or the @Table[mutatemental]{Mental Corruption Table} to see what happens.</p>\n<h4>Corruption Limits</h4>\n<p>A soul can only withstand so much corruption before it collapses upon itself, leaving a mutated, gibbering mess. Should you survive long enough to gain more mutations than your Toughness Bonus, or more mental corruptions than your Willpower Bonus, you have fallen to Chaos, your soul completely lost to the uncaring Chaos Gods. At this point, it’s time to create a new character. Your current one is now damned, becoming an NPC controlled by the GM, meaning you may well see the wretched creature again…</p>\n<h3>Losing Corruption Points</h3>\n<p>Once the claws of the Dark Gods have sunk into your soul, removing their vile stain is difficult, but not impossible. Beyond the less-than-desirable option of losing Corruption points by gaining mutations, there are two other methods of losing Corruption points: dark whispers and absolution .</p>\n<h4>Dark Whispers</h4>\n<p>Even considering the inscrutable plans of the Dark Gods is enough to break a pious man’s sanity, so trying to fathom their intent, and why they reach out to twist one mortal soul or another, is not just foolish, it’s extraordinarily dangerous. But reach out they do.</p>\n<p>The GM may ask to spend one of your Corruption points to use the darkness building in your soul to twist your actions. The choice to do this or not is always in your hands, but if you agree, you lose 1 Corruption Point. Examples of what may be asked include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Letting an enemy escape.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>‘Accidentally’ shooting an ally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Falling asleep on watch.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, if you deny the GM and choose to do none of those potentially terrible things, you keep your Corruption point, but the Ruinous Powers still hold a portion of your soul.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Be Very Careful</em></h3>\n<p><em>Used sparingly, Corruption Points are great fun as Faustian deals are made for rerolls and traded back for memorable roleplaying moments as minor betrayals spread, but if you’re playing with a group that doesn’t readily understand the Old World, the points can accrue very quickly, sending characters into a spiral of mutation and madness. This should probably be avoided. Mutation is effectively a death sentence if discovered, so it’s important new players are cautioned when their actions may lead to corruption. Just like every child in the Empire is warned of the dangers posed by the Ruinous Powers, players should be warned that Warpstone should not be touched or even approached, that tainted artefacts are dangerous, and the Cultists of Chaos should be avoided at all costs. Of course, the circumstances of the adventure at hand may force your group into the most horrendous situations with corruption around every corner, but that’s <strong>WFRP</strong>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Absolution</h4>\n<p>As Corruption points build, and you feel the oppressive fist of the Dark Gods curling around your beleaguered soul, your dread may lead you to seek absolution. But simply asking forgiveness from a local preacher won’t be enough. The stain of the Dark Gods’ touch isn’t so easily scrubbed clean. The exact limits of what is required to remove Corruption is left in the hands of the GM, but it is rarely, if ever, simple.</p>\n<p>Printed adventures may include situations where Corruption can be removed, but if you wish to seek your own route to absolution, consider the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cleanse a profane temple to the Dark Gods. Though the very act may expose you to more corruption…</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complete a holy pilgrimage and receive a blessing from a high priest at the end of the long, dangerous journey.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Destroy an unholy artefact, or otherwise render it safe, foiling the schemes of the Dark Gods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Join a holy order and dedicate your life to one of the Gods opposed to Chaos.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Options: Slow Manifestations</em></h3>\n<p><em>Manifesting a mutation of the body or mind can come quickly, but normally it’s a slow process, perhaps starting as an itch, patch of flaky skin, or a new tic, and only later developing into a new eye, unexpected feathers, or an entirely new mindset.

The symbol of the Third Order is the Coil of Life and the druids of the Jade Order wear green robes.</p>\n<p>Jade Wizards have power over nature and can cast spells that can cause twisting briars to spring from the earth, entire forests to appear, or bring mighty winds to blow away their enemies. At their command Jade Wizards can summon rain from a cloudless sky or cause the rocks of the earth to hurtle through the air. Jade Wizards love living things, for their studies teach them about the harmony of nature. They are often skilled practitioners of healing and restorative magic.</p>\n<p>The Jade College is the centre of the order, but few wizards remain there for long. Throughout the Empire there are hidden forest groves where druids conduct rituals and keep their secrets. These take the form of stone circles and often lie at the confluence of three streams, for such places are powerful in the magical lore of Ghyran. Within Altdorf, the college takes the form of a mossy, brick walled enclosure, plain and unimposing to the outside world, yet hidden within is a great arboretum where boughs form mighty halls. Amongst the glades of this hidden world are numerous pools and streams whose running water pours into a wondrous silver lake.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Seasonal Variations</em></h3>\n<p><em>The magical energies of </em>Ghyran <em>precipitate like rain upon the earth, forming pools which only those able to sense the Winds of Magic can see. These magical pools flow into natural watercourses and, for this reason, the power of </em>Ghyran <em>is closely bound up with water, vegetation, and all living things. Channelling (Ghyran) Tests benefit from +1 SL where water is abundant (a stream would not be enough, but rivers, lakes, and oceans are) but suffer from –1 SL in dry environments. Because Jade Wizards are so closely tied to the power of nature, their own powers tend to wax and wane with the seasons, being vigorous in spring, most powerful in summer, waning during autumn, and weakening during winter. Channelling (Ghyran) Tests benefit from +1 SL during the months of Pflugzeit and Vorgeheim but suffer from –1 SL during Ulriczeit and Vorhexen.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Semiotics of the Jade Order</h3>\n<p>The power of the Jade College spirals through the Wind of <em>Ghyran</em> and is represented by the Coil of Life. This rune embodies the cyclical flow of life in all its forms and is seen repeatedly in the traditions and vestments of the Jade Wizards, from the curving sickles many of them carry, to the ancient circles of cyclopean stone where they perform their rituals at the equinoxes and solstices.</p>\n<p>To Jade Wizards, the Coil of Life also serves as a reminder of the continual shift of reality. Just as the seasons change from summer to winter and back again, or as living beings die, only for life to be born anew from their mouldering flesh, so does the cycle of zenith and nadir dominate every facet of existence — Jade Wizards are the least perturbed by the vicissitudes and uncertainties of the Winds of Magic. The druids also find meaning in the symbols of the oak leaf and a triskele formed of three intersecting coils.</p>\n<p>Jade Wizards often go about barefoot so that they can feel the Wind of <em>Ghyran</em> upon their feet. Each wizard carries a sickle, small or large, which is the badge of attainment amongst their kind.</p>\n<h3>Gardens of Jade</h3>\n<p>Home for Jade Wizards is usually a well-maintained and thriving garden. The sort of terrain a wizard prefers is likely to be more tangled and overgrown than a mundane gardener or farmer might prefer, but there is a certain aestheticism in the more natural garden, too. Druids, especially as they age, find great solace in such places. They often settle in such an area and hone it through the years to their idea of verdant perfection.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/items/mage-leaf.webp\" width=\"166\" height=\"247\" /></div>\n<p>There are several gardens across the Empire that have been tended over hundreds of years. These act as welcome respite to druids as they travel through the land. Many, especially those in or near cities, are walled off from the general populace, but many are part of the natural landscape and barely noticeable to the untrained eye. Some of these places incorporate ancient carved stones linked to the Old Faith or are ancient Elven places of power.</p>\n<p>Druids carry a sickle as their badge. These are symbolic of their power over trees. The power to cut down, but more pertinently, the power to hone and make thrive, and the power of restraint. Apprentices carry copper sickles and are awarded silver ones when they become a licenced magister. Senior druids carry golden sickles.</p>\n<p>All druids carry staffs of living wood. These can be anything from an almost bare stick with a single leaf, almost indistinguishable from a walking stick or quarterstaff, to verging on a full-size tree. Druids plant their staffs in the ground at night and when they are not using them, to aid with their growth, but a Jade Wizard can keep their staff alive even without such help.</p>\n<p>Though they tolerate cities, and the Jade Wind flows there readily enough, druids generally feel more comfortable when they are in their element, among thriving plant life. A tradition of communal living has established itself within the order. As Jade Wizards have settled down in their chosen location with their families, they attract apprentices and other Jade Wizards, as well as more mundane colleagues. These communes often grow up outside the remit of petty barons and other powers. Local authorities would be keen to tax them but are usually too afraid to try. The communes often appear more like religious communities than magical ones.</p>\n<p>Many Jade Wizards get wanderlust, come the spring. They will set off for lands unknown, simply following their nose, keen to find whatever they will find. This is encouraged and no wizard reaches a high level within the order without going wandering at least a few times during their career. As is the nature of the Jade Wizard, however, come the end of summer, the wizard returns home, or back to Altdorf, weary but greater for their experience.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Jade Wind","type":"text","_id":"MVwOuM2YKhUvA1E1","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><em>Ghyran</em> falls to the world like the spring rain falls to the soil.

But it also springs up around the wild and overgrown, where growth is rampant and less hospitable: steaming jungles, the ocean littoral, and tangled forests.</p><p>At its most vibrant, the wind appears as a bright green, drowning out the more sombre hues of the mundane world. It is at its brightest where growth and health are at their most vital. It swirls as bright jade around new growth and chartreuse around newborn animals. Old growth fades to a deep emerald and where life is diseased or in decline it darkens and muddies.</p><p>The Jade Wind is not just about plants, it is intrinsic to all life. Animals kick up eddies of Jade wherever they go. Anywhere the living make their homes also attracts <em>Ghyran</em>. It is the wind most associated with vitality, health, and fecundity. It is the wind of childbirth and healing. Wherever there is life, the Jade Wind blows.</p><p>But where there is life, there must be death. In the very moment of death <em>Ghyran</em> is released in gusts and flurries. Jade springs readily from the life force of the freshly dead, especially those who were energetic and youthful in their life. It is even said that the dead lie beneath all the order’s most spectacular gardens. The uncomfortable conclusion that some quietly wager is that living sacrifice would feed Jade spells. Jade Wizards will not talk of this.</p><p>The Jade Wind blows greatest in the spring and summer as life itself approaches its apogee, and then begins to diminish as winter nears. So too Jade Wizards are at their most vital at the start of this cycle, and they decline with the year.</p><h3>The Jade College</h3><p>The Jade College itself is a wonderfully bucolic walled garden in the heart of Altdorf. A high, green-brick wall separates the bustling and filthy city from the tranquil grounds. Behind the wall, visitors to the college could be forgiven for thinking that they are in an idyllic country setting. Streams run through the grounds, replenishing fishponds overlooked by thriving trees, flowers bloom through every season, and birds and bees flit across the scene. Manicured lawns surround standing stones and deer graze within the surrounding woods. The trees teem with exotic and local fruits, and nuts, berries, and cereals grow unchecked. The gardens also contain a few unkempt tangled areas where Amber Wizards are apt to stay when visiting the big city.</p><p>The entire gardens are set out in a circular design, with a spiral grassy pathway circling the garden three times before reaching the physical college building at the heart of the grounds. Unwanted visitors sometimes find themselves circling the grounds many times yet never reaching the centre. When they turn around they find their way back to the gate almost instantly.</p><p>The structure itself has been grown from the limbs of many different trees. The entire complex is living, from leafy ceilings, organically woven wattle walls, to mossy beds, and great wooden halls. Fruit and vegetables hang from the walls and grow from the floor ready to be plucked and eaten by passing magisters. Dotted around the gardens are several sheltered copses which are effectively rooms of the college, too. They are cleverly, or magically, arranged, to be surprisingly sheltered from the elements.</p><p>Beneath the structure, within a great circular hall formed as the trunk of a single great oak, is the college library. The most ancient and sacred texts of the order are etched on preternaturally preserved scrolls of bark. Like the roots of a great tree, countless passages run from this central chamber and disappear into the depths of the earth.</p><p>It is rumoured that the college grounds are kept in order by an army of animated servitors made from plant matter, with branches and vines for limbs. They are also said to guard the place at night. There are any number of stories around Altdorf docks from those who know someone who knows someone who broke into the college and had to flee mysterious walking trees.</p><p>In the spring and summer, when the college grounds are at their most verdant, the wizards who refrain from wandering are busy and energetic. In the months of decline towards the winter solstice, the wizards return tired and in need of rejuvenation; the Jade College is shaded in sombre melancholy.</p><h3>Relationships</h3><h4>The Amber College</h4><p>Despite their famous good nature, Jade Wizards often find themselves sympathetic to the more misanthropic Amber Wizards, even offering them a home away from home in Altdorf itself. They have good relations generally with that brotherhood, but it is sometimes strained. The Jade College finds itself doing the shamans’ bidding more often than they would like and resent the fact that they seem to put more effort into advancing the Amber cause among the other colleges than the Amber Wizards bother to do themselves.</p><h4>Hedge Witches</h4><p>Though there is no formal structure among hedge witches and many of their beliefs and tenets have been lost to time, if there is an institution in Altdorf that is sympathetic to their cause, it would be the Jade College. There are persistent rumours that Jade Wizards find themselves researching hedgecraft for academic reasons.</p><h4>The Eonir</h4><p>The college has sporadic interest in the Elves of Laurelorn. The Lore of Life has been enhanced greatly from exchanges with the Eonir over the years, but the insight and power they provide seems to come at a price. Many in the college have felt manipulated by the Elves, and so help and advice from Tor Lithanel is only rarely sought by the wisest Jade Mothers.</p><h4>The Cult of Rhya</h4><p>Surprisingly, there is some tension between the @UUID[JournalEntry.Q9sQhbDN8NUHXYdA.JournalEntryPage.MVwOuM2YKhUvA1E1#the-jade-college]{Jade College} and the cult of Rhya. Though these two institutions are often viewed as two sides of the same coin, many within the cult resent the power the college wields. They see Jade magic as a cheating shortcut to their own ends. Power given through the deity is pure and good, whereas the power the wizards wield must be tainted by Chaos. Every Jade Wizard that resorts to <em>Dhar</em> is proof of the cult’s fears.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Tochter Grunfeld","type":"text","_id":"vc000lXgYSy5ZLgg","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/actors/tochter-grunfeld.webp\" width=\"222\" height=\"271\" /></div>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.47AVLmEhgioAt7O3]{Tochter Grunfeld}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.47AVLmEhgioAt7O3]{Grunfeld} is the matriarch of a commune, Bluetegarten, east of Wurtbad.

She has developed a network of spies from the local populace there who are dedicated to keeping an eye out for any strange activity and reporting back to her. A number of these are her erstwhile commune dwellers and their family members, some of whom are now high-ranking in the cult of Rhya, and some are powerful witches.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/hook.webp\" width=\"73\" height=\"46\" /></div>\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Witch Way</em></h3>\n<p><em>Grunfeld has long been taking an interest in a Sylvanian baron whom she suspects of falling to vampirism.

Dwarfs disdain magic, perhaps because they are partially immune to it, and no Dwarf wizards are known. Halflings are largely indifferent towards magic: except when it delivers impressive or entertaining spectacles.</p><p>The Elves directed (as a condition of their tuition) that Human spellcasters should each only use a single Wind of Magic. They argued that while it is possible to cast spells by drawing from multiple winds, doing so is a risky proposition for the feeble, corruptible Human mind. This wisdom has been adopted by the Colleges, and each specialises in a single colour.</p><p>Some witches outside the College system consider these restrictions ludicrous, an attempt by the Elves to keep the most powerful magics to themselves. Drawing on multiple winds is a quick route to power, but also to damnation. Many an unlicensed witch has proved unable to resist this temptation, a practice usually called Dark Magic, only to be brought low by Witch Hunters.</p><p>Others believe magical energies are not so easily categorised. Many different types of ‘wizard’ and ‘witch’ can be found throughout the Old World, with some practicing magic that seems to lie outside colour magic, such as the cold-hearted Ice Witches of Kislev, or the shamans and sorcerers found amongst some of the other species besetting the Empire, such as the Greenskins.</p><h3>The Language of Magick</h3><p>The Winds of Magic may blow through all things incessantly, but they are relatively harmless until harnessed by the Language of Magick. For reasons not fully understood, when certain sounds are uttered by those attuned to magic, the Winds answer. The Colleges of Magic teach a complex language called the <em>lingua praestantia</em> which form the basis of their spells, originally taught to Humanity by the Elves. Although extraordinarily difficult to correctly annunciate, it is a significant simplification of the Elven tongue <em>Anoqeyån</em> , the language used by the Elves to shape their own, more powerful magics. Wizards of the Colleges and the Elves are not alone in their knowledge of the Language of Magick. Its complex forms are also spoken by many magical creatures found across the Old World, including Spirits and Daemons. Many witches seem to instinctively understand the language, almost as if it somehow wormed inside them, begging to be spoken as a spell.</p><h3>The Eight Lores</h3><p>Each of the eight Winds of Magic has an associated Lore, a body of spells and knowledge its adepts use. Each of the eight Colleges of Magic is dedicated to the study of a single Lore, and their buildings are constructed to focus their Wind to facilitate relatively safe tuition.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/hysh.webp\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div><h4>The Lore of Light</h4><p>The Lore of Light relates to <em>Hysh</em> , the white wind. <em>Hysh</em> is considered the most difficult Wind to perceive and manipulate, appearing diffuse even to those skilled with the Sight. This makes it tricky to manipulate but less unpredictable than other Winds. <em>Hysh</em> is associated with patience, intelligence, and purity. The Hierophants of the Light Order are acclaimed for their discipline, knowledge, and devoted opposition to Chaos.</p><p>Spells from the Lore of Light are some of the most powerful, including piercing rays of blinding light, and those that banish Daemons and Undead creatures from the mortal plane. There are also more gentle applications of <em>Hysh</em> used to heal comrades or clarify thought.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/chamon.webp\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div><h4>The Lore of Metal</h4><p>The Lore of Metal relates to <em>Chamon</em> , the gold wind. <em>Chamon</em> appears dense and heavy to @UUID[.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#second-sight]{Second Sight}, sinking into the earth and coalescing within dense metals such as lead and gold. The Alchemists of the Gold Order have a reputation for being unusually prosaic in their attitudes for wizards, and many are as interested in learning the facts of physics and chemistry as they are in the working of magic.</p><p>Spells from the Lore of Metal often involve the transmutation or alteration of metal. On the battlefield, alchemists have been known to cause fine steel armour and weaponry to corrode or melt, to weigh their foes down with suddenly dense armour, or to enchant their allies’ weaponry with uncanny power.</p><div class=\"journal-image\n    float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/ghyran.webp\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div><h4>The Lore of Life</h4><p>The Lore of Life relates to <em>Ghyran</em> , the jade wind. Free flowing <em>Ghyran</em> is associated with growth, fertility and nourishment. To those with @UUID[.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#second-sight]{The Sight}, Ghyran appears much like a light rain, falling to the ground and pooling in eddying swirls. It sinks into the soil and is drawn up into the roots of plants from where it goes on to nourish all living things. The Druids of the Jade Order often prefer life away from the cities, attuned to the seasons and the natural world.</p><p>Spells from the Lore of Life commonly involve healing and rejuvenation, from healing wounds to causing a barren field to burst with life. They can have offensive applications, too. The enemies of a Druid may find themselves suddenly tangled up in wickedly sharp brambles and vines.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/azyr.webp\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div><h4>The Lore of Heavens</h4><p>The Lore of Heavens relates to <em>Azyr</em> , the blue wind. It cascades through the skies over the Old World, crackling through the heavens, like a great charged cloud. Astromancers of the Celestial Order, known for their calm and contemplative manners, use the wind to scry the future, the lens of <em>Azyr</em> influencing what they can see in the stars.</p><p>Spells from the Lore of Heavens involve the manipulation of fate, throwing up protective barriers, or cursing a foe with an unnatural run of bad luck. On the battlefield, Astromancers also control elemental forces, blasting their enemies with bolts of lightning, or even drawing down shooting stars from the heavens.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/ulgu.webp\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div><h4>The Lore of Shadows</h4><p>The Lore of Shadows relates to <em>Ulgu</em> , the grey wind. To @UUID[.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#second-sight]{the Sight} it appears a thick fog, gathering in pools wherever intrigue and deceit are practiced, rising into great storms and tempests when conflict breaks out. Wizards of the Grey Order, known as Grey Guardians, are secretive in their ways and given to uncertain loyalties. Despite this, the Grey Order is renowned for its wisdom and skill in negotiations, and is often called upon for diplomatic missions.</p><p>Spells from the Lore of Shadows can be used to mask or obfuscate, confusing and disorienting their foes. In battle, the shadowy, insubstantial tendrils of <em>Ulgu</em> they wield can pierce to the heart of their foes, eviscerating the most well-protected troops, yet leaving armour eerily intact.</p><div class=\"journal-image\n    float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/shyish.webp\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div><h4>The Lore of Death</h4><p>The Lore of Death relates to <em>Shyish</em> , the purple wind. It is attracted to places of death, such as battlefields, Gardens of Morr, and sites of execution. The wind is said to blow strongest during times of transition, so wizards of the Amethyst Order tend to work their greatest rites during the twilight before dawn, or during sunset. While <em>Shyish</em> is related to time and mortality, it is distinct from Necromancy, the illegal practice of raising and binding the dead, which uses the dark magic of <em>Dhar</em> in lieu of <em>Shyish</em> . Indeed, the Amethyst Order, much like the Cult of Morr, works tirelessly to combat the threat of Necromancy.</p><p>Nevertheless, spells from the Lore of Death resemble Necromancy to the untrained eye. They can drain their targets of life force, spread fear among their enemies, and contact the spirits of the departed.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/aqshy.webp\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div><h4>The Lore of Fire</h4><p>The Lore of Fire relates to <em>Aqshy</em> , the red wind. <em>Aqshy</em> is a hot and searing wind associated with brashness, courage, and zeal and is drawn to empirical heat. The Pyromancers of the Bright Order are bold and hot-tempered and make for impressively destructive Battle Wizards.</p><p>Many of the spells from the Lore of Fire are offensive in nature, enabling the caster to conjure up great balls of fire, or cause the blades of their allies to burst into flame. Even their non-offensive spells, such as crude healing magics, are still destructive in nature. Bright wizards are also adept at inspiring their allies, rallying their courage and inspiring bravery and loyalty in the troops with which they serve.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/magic/ghur.webp\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></div><h4>The Lore of Beasts</h4><p>The Lore of Beasts relates to <em>Ghur</em> , the amber wind, a cold, primal force associated with the savage wilds and the beasts living there. To those with @UUID[.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#second-sight]{the Sight} <em>Ghur</em> seems to blow weakly in areas where the wilderness has been tamed and settlements constructed. This may explain why the Shamans of the Amber Order often take up a hermitic existence and shun their fellow men.</p><p>The spells of the Lore of Beasts allow a Shaman to communicate with animals, request their aid, and even summon them to battle. Shapeshifting magic may also be used by the wizard to adopt animal forms.</p><h3>Elven Magic</h3><p>Elves are long lived beings whose minds are more attuned to the workings of magic than those of humanity. High Elven mages usually train in several, sometimes all, of the eight winds as part of their apprenticeships, before the most promising move on to study High Magic: <em>Qhaysh</em> . This is the blending of multiple winds of magic together into a blinding, coruscating energy. This magic is impressive and difficult, and Elves claim it is beyond the capacity of humankind.</p><p>The Wood Elves, too, make use of the eight Winds of Magic, though their Spellsingers usually focus upon the Jade and Amber Winds. The most powerful usually go on to study either High Magic like High Elves, or dread Dark Magic – a foul mixing of the eight winds that can create tremendously destructive effects.</p><h3>Dark Magic</h3><p>While difficult to master <em>Qhaysh</em> is the safe blending of multiple Winds of Magic, <em>Dhar</em>, known commonly as Dark Magic, is much more dangerous method of casting spells using multiple winds. It is usually only practiced by evil sorcerers, Necromancers, and powerful witches, offering them a seductive source of raw power, yet one laced with terrible side-effects. Few can channel <em>Dhar</em> for long, without succumbing to the corrupting influence of the malevolent wind, their bodies and minds being warped into unnatural states.</p><p><em>Dhar</em> resembles a stagnant mire to those with @UUID[.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#second-sight]{the Sight}, pooling in places saturated with evil, or corruption: the herdstones of Beastmen, the dark idols of chaos cultists, and places where great workings of several of the Winds of Magic took place. <em>Dhar</em> is so dense and potent that it can independently coalesce or crystalize into physical matter, eventually forming the widely feared substance called warpstone.</p><h4>Warpstone</h4><p>Warpstone is a lump of pure magic in the material plane. Its unnatural provenance is immediately obvious to all who see it, as it hurts the eyes and mutates anything drawing close for too long. Although its form varies, it often holds hard facets like flint, and radiates a queasy green glow.</p><p>Close examination of the substance is not to be undertaken lightly. Warpstone is the stuff of Chaos made manifest and its presence is deeply corrupting. Those who have direct contact with warpstone risk illness, madness and mutation, and anyone who ingests so much as a pinch of the stuff dooms themselves to catastrophic warping of body and mind. Nonetheless, the world is full of reckless, ambitious fools who know that the volatile and dangerous substance is a tremendous source of energy for spells and rituals.</p><p>The followers of Chaos and the Skaven do not hesitate to use it. To them, warpstone is a literal gift from the gods to be valued above gold and jewels, and to be used against their enemies.</p><h3>Other Lores</h3><p>In less frequented corners of the Empire, in villages and rural communities far from the influence of the Colleges of Magic, older forms of magic are still practiced even though they are outlawed and punishable by death. There are uncounted varieties of these, but two of the more common Lores still practised by Humans are Hedgecraft and Witchcraft.</p><h4>The Lore of Hedgecraft</h4><p>Practitioners of Hedgecraft generally live quiet lives on the fringes of smaller human settlements, in service to local communities. Just as they live their lives in the ‘hedge’ between civilisation and the wilds of nature, so much of their magic concerns itself with the liminal space between the material world and the realm of the spirits. Their magic tends to focus on folklore, spirits and the natural world, as well as means to aid the rural communities which shelter them. Once a relatively common sight in the Empire, over two centuries of persecution since the founding of the Colleges of Magic has all but wiped them out.</p><h4>The Lore of Witchcraft</h4><p>While the Lore of Witchcraft is not inherently malicious, or tied to the gods of Chaos, it has a justly earned reputation for evil and unpleasantness. Often self-taught and using multiple Winds of Magic, those practising the Lore of Witchcraft lack the discipline or knowledge of College wizards and are at a significant risk of corruption. The combination of the corrosive effects of <em>Dhar</em> and being shunned by right-minded folk of the Empire often makes these Witches bitter, spiteful souls, their hearts hard and flinty, their gaze baleful and ill-omened.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":""}}},{"name":"Magic Rules","type":"text","_id":"BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3>Second Sight</h3><p>The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent allows you to perceive the Winds of Magic, and how magic influences the world around you. Second Sight affects all your senses, and how it manifests is dependent on individual experience and training: So, where <em>Aqshy</em> may have a hot, cinnamon odour to one pyromancer, it could feel like searing ear itches to another.</p><p>If you have @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight}, you may use any appropriate Skills with your aethyric senses, most commonly your Intuition, Perception, and Track Skills. For example, a wizard following the trail of a fleeing witch could make a Track test, following the faint traces of <em>Dhar</em> in the witch’s path, rather than their literal footsteps. Or a Witch looking to see what kind of magic had gathered locally could use Perception to examine the Winds more closely. Like the mundane senses, Second Sight does not simply switch off, which is a source of great discomfort to those who would rather have no truck with the Winds of Magic but cannot help what they perceive. This means the GM may request Tests, or take Tests on your behalf, to see if you spot subtle magical details in your surrounding environment, even if you’re not looking for them.</p><h3>Spells</h3><p>There are four types of spell: Petty, Arcane, Lore, and Chaos spells. Petty spells are simple tricks that use negligible amounts of magic. Arcane Spells are generic spells open to those studying any Lore of Magic or Chaos Magic. Lore spells are those you can only learn if you know that Lore; i.e. to learn spells from the Lore of Fire, you need the Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent. Chaos spells are those practiced by those who’ve lost their souls to Chaos.</p><h4>Memorising Spells</h4><p>Holding the complex linguistic structures of Language (Magick) in mind is a challenging task, so simply transcribing a spell into your grimoire does not allow you learn a spell.</p><p>To memorise a spell — and therefore be able to cast it without access to your grimoire — you typically need to spend the amount of XP noted in your spellcasting Talent (see @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR]{Skills and Talents}). Once a spell has been memorised, a spellcaster knows it permanently, barring special circumstances.</p><h3>Casting Test</h3><p>To cast a spell, make a Language (Magick) Test. If you succeed, match your SL to the Casting Number (CN) of the spell (listed in the individual spell description). If your SL is equal to or higher than the CN of the spell, it is cast as explained in the spell’s description. If failed, the spell attempt fails, and nothing else happens.</p><h4>Critical Casting</h4><p>If the casting roll is a @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#criticals-and-fumbles]{Critical}, the Winds of Magic have flared dangerously high, granting you extra power, but at a cost. Unless you have the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.BYChSVfMG004eflQ]{Instinctive Diction} Talent, you roll on the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table} as the power moves beyond your control, but you may also choose one of the following effects:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Critical Cast</strong>: If the spell causes Damage, it also inflicts a @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.WCivInLZrqEtZzF4#critical-wounds]{Critical Wound}.</p></li><li><p><strong>Total Power</strong>: The spell is cast, no matter its CN and your rolled SL, but can be Dispelled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unstoppable Force</strong>: If you scored enough SL to cast your spell, it cannot be Dispelled.</p></li></ul><h4>Fumbled Casting</h4><p>If you lose control of the magical energy you are channelling, things invariably go awry. If you Fumble your Casting Test, you suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast Table}.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 class=\"sidebar-title\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Malignant Influences</em></h4><p><em>Casting close to sources of Corruption makes controlling the Winds of Magic much more difficult. When attempting a Language (Magick) or Channelling Test in the vicinity of a @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.115GzWrmkD4viyy5#corrupting-influences]{Corrupting Influence}, any roll of an 8 (representing the eight-pointed symbol of Chaos) on the units die results in a @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} as the Magic goes wild. If you already have a Minor Miscast on the Test for another reason, the Miscast escalates to a @Table[majormis]{Major Miscast}.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Duration</h4><p>If a spell is successfully cast, it remains in effect for its Duration unless it is dispelled. You may not simply end your spells already in play, but you may attempt to Dispel them.</p><h4>Grimoires</h4><p>Some spellcasters own a spellbook, or grimoire, in which they transcribe their spells. Apprentices copy spells from their master, while experienced wizards will actively seek out new spells from other wizards, often trading spells for favours. A spellcaster may cast a spell directly from a grimoire if the spell belongs to a Lore they possess. Doing so doubles the Casting Number.</p><h4>Magic Missiles</h4><p>Some spells are marked as <em>magic missiles</em>; these are damage-causing spells that all follow the same rules. When a <em>magic missile</em> is successfully cast and targets another character, the Hit Location struck is determined by reversing the dice rolled on the Language (Magick) Test and referring to the Hit Location Table. The SL of the Language (Magick) Test is added to the spell’s listed Damage and your Willpower Bonus to determine the total inflicted Damage. This Damage is reduced by the target’s Toughness and Armour Points as normal.</p><h4>Touch Spells in Combat</h4><p>Certain spells require you to touch the target. If in combat, or if the target is unwilling to be touched, you must make an <strong>Opposed Melee (Brawling)</strong> Test (generally opposed by the Melee or Dodge Skill) after completing the Casting Test. If you do this and your spell was a magic missile, the Melee (Brawling) Test is used to determine Hit Location struck, not the Language (Magick) Test.</p><h4>Ingredients</h4><p>Spellcasters may channel their magic through an appropriate ingredient before unleashing their spells. Doing this offers protection against Miscasts as the attuned ingredient absorbs the worst of any magical backlash.</p><p>If you use an ingredient when casting, any suffered Major Miscast becomes a Minor Miscast, and any Minor Miscast has no effect. If used in this way, the ingredient is consumed or destroyed by the process, even if no Miscast was rolled.</p><p>Ingredients cost the CN in silver shillings for Arcane and Lore spells. Whenever you purchase a new ingredient, mark on your character sheet which spell it supports; ingredients only work for specific spells, not for all spells in your Lore. For those looking to add character to their ingredients, sample ingredients for each of the primary Lores of Magic are provided by the individual spell lists.</p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>Ingredients are a subtype of the <strong>Trapping </strong>item. To create one, create a trapping, change the <strong>Trapping Type</strong> to <strong>Ingredient</strong>. Then in the character sheet, assign the Ingredient to the spell it can be used with (note that this requires the Actor has at least 1 Spell).</p><p>When you're ready to use the ingredient, select the Ingredient to be used by the Spell before casting it.</p></blockquote><h4>Limitations</h4><p>As spells are spoken, you must be able to speak — not gagged, strangled, or underwater — to cast. If your voice is inhibited, the Difficulty of your Language (Magick) Test to cast a spell should be increased by the GM. Further, the Language of Magick needs to be spoken (or sung, for those using the @UUID[.fcaxScAhJ2Z02nbP#the-lore-of-light]{Lore of Light}) clearly, and often loudly, to ensure spells work; magic is anything but subtle. As a loose guide, the higher the CN of a spell, the louder the spell is chanted.</p><p>Each of your spells can only be in effect once, meaning you have to wait for a cast spell to come to an end, or be dispelled, before using the same spell again. Further, spells providing bonuses or penalties do not stack. Instead, the best bonus and worst penalty is applied from every spell cast upon you. So, if you had a spell providing a bonus of +20 Willpower, and another providing +10 Willpower, you gain a bonus of +20 Willpower, not +30.</p><p>Lastly, unless otherwise specified, you always need to be able to see — i.e. have Line of Sight — to your target.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Advantage and Magic</em></h3><p><em>Advantage in combat applies to Casting Tests, not Channelling Tests. When casting magic, you can also gain Advantage in the following way: If the target has already had a spell from the same Lore cast upon it in that Round, gain +1 Advantage as you cast, as the upswelling of your Wind aids channelling magic. See @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#advantage]{Advantage} for Advantage rules.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Channelling</h3><p>Some magical spells require far more magic than can normally be found ambiently flowing through the world. To power such spells, it is possible to draw the Winds of Magic and concentrate them into a more powerful form by using the Channelling Skill. Channelling the Winds of Magic can be a dangerous procedure, but it is the only sure way to cast some powerful spells. To channel magic for a spell, make an Extended Channelling Test.</p><p>When your SL reaches the CN of your selected spell, you have channelled enough magic to cast it. On the next Round, you can cast your spell using the normal Casting rules, but count the chosen spell’s Casting Number as 0. If the casting Test fails, you also lose all your channelled magical energy, and suffer a @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} as it all writhes free from your Aethyric grasp.</p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>The <strong>SL </strong>column of the Magic tab represents the SL accumulated from Channelling. You can left or right click to increase or decrease (respectively) the value manually. </p></blockquote><h4>Critical Channelling</h4><p>If you roll a Critical when Channelling, you have channelled a mighty flow of magic and can cast your spell next Round regardless of the SL you’ve scored in the Extended Test so far; however, so much magic so quickly concentrated in one place results in some magical backlash: roll 1d100 on the Minor Miscast Table unless you have the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.1IZWRr7BYOIcqPlQ]{Aethyric Attunement} Talent.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/miscast.webp\" width=\"158\" height=\"200\" /></div><h4>Fumble</h4><p>Channelling the Winds of Magic in a large flow is dangerous. You count any double or any roll ending in a 0 over your Skill as a Fumble, so, 00, 99, 90, 88, and so on. If you fumble a Channelling Test, you suffer a Miscast. Roll 1d100 and consult the @Table[majormis]{Major Miscast} Table.</p><h4>Interruptions</h4><p>Concentration is vital when channelling. If you are distracted by anything — loud noises, suffering damage, flashing lights, or similar — you must pass a <strong>Hard (–20) Cool</strong> Test, or suffer a @Table[minormis]{Minor Miscast} and lose all SL you have accrued in the Extended Channelling Test so far.</p><h4>Repelling the Winds</h4><p>Wearing colours appropriate to the Wind of Magic you are manipulating helps attract the magic to you. This is the reason most wizards choose to dress in the traditional garb of their order.</p><p>All Casting and Channelling Tests suffer a –1 SL penalty if you are dressed inappropriately for the Wind of Magic you are trying to attract, as determined by the GM. Specifically, metal and leather armour repel most of the Winds: metal is laden with the golden wind Chamon , while leather retains traces of the amber Ghur . As such, spellcasters wearing armour suffer –1 SL penalty to all Casting and Channelling Tests for every Armour Point on the location with the most armour. Casters with the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.3O9clK7LGyuLTHPW]{Arcane Magic (Metal)} Talent may wear metal armour without penalty; those with @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.3O9clK7LGyuLTHPW]{Arcane Magic (Beasts)} Talent may ignore penalties from leather armour.</p><h3>Dispelling</h3><p>If a spell targets you, or a point you can see within Willpower yards, you may oppose the Casting Test with Language (Magick) as you chant a counterspell. Make an <strong>Opposed Language (Magick)</strong> Test. If you win the Opposed Test, you dispel the incoming spell; if you lose, the spell uses the SL of the Opposed Test to determine whether the casting was successful as normal. You may only attempt to dispel a single spell every Round.</p><h4>Dispelling Persistent Spells</h4><p>If a spell has a lasting effect, you may attempt to dispel that spell for your Action. This is done by making an <strong>Extended Language (Magick)</strong> Test. When your SL reaches the CN of the ongoing spell, you successfully dispel it.</p><p>Multiple spellcasters attempting to dispel the same spell each roll separately. If they cast using the same Lore, they may decide to make an @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.lQThXbnpgQ30VBXR#assistance]{Assisted Test} instead.</p><h3>Using Warpstone</h3><blockquote><p>Officially the use of warpstone is precluded by the powers that be. Unofficially, I can say that it is officially never used within this college. Officially, I cannot say what unofficial uses it might have. But unofficially, I might be able to say it has certain unofficial uses. But certainly it is officially unofficial.</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>–Wilhelm Holswig-Schliestein, Grey Guardian, Raconteur, and Liar</em></p></blockquote><p>Warpstone is such a rich source of power that even a small fragment of the stuff will offer enough magic to power any spell in short order. Of course, the wisdom of powering any spell with Warpstone, and the wisdom of carrying Warpstone upon your person, is debateable.</p><p>A wizard using Warpstone when Casting and Channelling doubles their SL for the appropriate tests. In addition, Casting or Channelling with Warpstone is a corrupting influence.

If you have Willpower 65, you can learn 6 of the 8 Arcane Lores. However, doing this takes time and effort. You can’t purchase a new Arcane Magic Talent until you have mastered your previous one by taking at least 20 Advances in the Channelling Skill of, and learning at least 8 spells from, your Lore. Alternatively, any wizard can learn a single Dark Lore in addition to another Lore, assuming they are foolish enough and can find a teacher or forbidden grimoire to study.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Options: The Swirling Winds</em></h3><p><em>The Winds of Magic swirl in unfathomable patterns and unpredictable gusts. Before every scene — or even every round in magically turbulent areas — the GM can roll for the strength of the Winds relevant to the scene, to see whether they are blowing strongly or weakly. The modifier can be added to your Casting and Channelling Tests. The GM could decide to do this only in areas where the Winds of Magic are particularly wild, for example in the aftermath of powerful spells, at magical loci, near Chaotic portals, and when Morrslieb is at its fullest.

Fortunately, ingredients for the Lore of Witchcraft are cheap and readily available: body parts of small animals for the most part. Ingredients cost a spell’s CN in brass pennies, instead of silver shillings, to purchase. Alternatively, a Witch may forage for parts, using the Outdoor Survival skill: a successful foraging roll receives 1 + SL ingredients, as described under @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR.JournalEntryPage.cFqWFER60SjM5Wn3#options:-gathering-food-and-herbs]{Gathering Food and Herbs}.</p><p>Ingredients: Witches use a horrific mixture of animal body parts, often harvested when a creature is still alive. It is not uncommon to find them clutching lizard eyes, dog toes, donkey gizzard, or much, much worse in their bloody hands as they cast their foul magics.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.spells.NytMCgP0IXtHnFwm]{Blight}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.spells.a8npXWG2o4BxhtVV]{Creeping Menace}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.spells.ZOlM8KjLfNIefAb0]{Curse of Crippling Pain}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.spells.sq47SZ1v9Pofa4L1]{Curse of Ill-Fortune}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.spells.PkqPqy3Fy9fawQZ8]{Haunting Horror}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.spells.CnydL8p3PVAuF98w]{The Evil Eye}</p><h2>Dark Magic</h2><p>The following provides two short lists of four Dark Magic spells.</p><h3>The Lore of Daemonology</h3><p>The forbidden Lore of Daemonology is concerned with summoning, binding, and controlling Daemons, typically to empower the spellcaster.

While the Players are busy with their single, measly Character, you’re in charge of the entire world! If you’re a new GM this can be a little daunting, but don’t worry, you’ll get the hang of it quickly, and we’ll walk you through the basics here.</p><p>The most important responsibility of a GM is to make sure everyone has fun, including you. You’ll be juggling roles of storyteller, umpire, and host, but don’t lose sight of the fact that the reason everyone is playing the game is to have a good time. Balance your storytelling with allowing Players spotlight time and autonomy in their actions. If a scene isn’t working, wrap it up quickly and move on. Balance the game rules with everyone’s enjoyment of the game — if something seems counter-intuitive or is taking too long, change it. Always focus on what your group finds fun.</p><p><strong>You are the world</strong>. Everything the Players interact with comes from you. You provide the world they explore. Your descriptions tell them what they see, hear, touch, smell, and taste. You’ll play the role of the people and creatures with which they interact. You describe the outcome of every action they take and determine how the game rules are applied.</p><p><strong>You are the rules</strong>. Make sure you understand the rules so the game runs smoothly and quickly. Be familiar with the rulebook so you can find what you need. Choose quickly if you are going to resolve an action with a GM decision or if you want the Player to make a Test. This choice will partly be a matter of personal style — do you and your Players like relying on the Character sheets to define what happens or do you prefer to save dice rolls for only the most important situations? Correctly and openly interpreting the results of Tests demonstrates to your Players that their actions have consequences, and that you are consistent and fair in your application of the rules.</p><p><strong>You are the plot</strong>. Before the game you’ll prepare the adventure, making sure you know what events are planned to take place, and who is involved in them. It is generally a good idea to have some contingency plans in place should the Players leap to the wrong conclusions and go off at a tangent (they will do this more often than you might think!). Make sure you have all the game information for the main characters in the adventure, along with anyone or anything the Characters might have to fight. Be familiar with the adventure’s background and the area it takes place in, and you will be able to improvise effectively. You can also prepare some stock events to use in case improvisation is required.</p><p><strong>You are the leader</strong>. Encourage good playing by making sure that everyone has a chance to participate, and that the game runs smoothly. Remind Players that rules discussions take place outside the game, and that you need to be able to get on with running the game to achieve maximum fun! Be thoughtful and respectful of your Players. Be aware of content that might be uncomfortable for some people, for instance graphic violence, sex, or horror. Check it’s okay before those subjects come up in a game. Justify your authority by being fair to everyone, consistent in how you apply the rules, and running the best Sigmar-blessed game this side of the Worlds Edge Mountains.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/alley.webp\" /></div><h3>General Advice</h3><p>There’s a lot of advice on running games out there. It’s a huge subject and requires much more space than we have here, so we’re adding a lot of advice to the Cubicle 7 website – keep checking back as we plan to keep building up that section. The rest of this chapter provides some specific advice for what to do at different stages of a game.</p><p>As a starter — or refresher for experienced GMs — here’s a condensed list of things to think about:</p><ul><li><p>Get to know this book well.</p></li><li><p>Give the players what they want from the game without ruining your own plans.</p></li><li><p>Make sure new groups of Characters have reasons to be adventuring together.</p></li><li><p>Consider how to handle or bypass content a player might not find to their taste.</p></li><li><p>Bookmark sections you will be returning to often, such as @UUID[JournalEntry.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f]{Magic} if one of your players is a wizard.</p></li><li><p>Be aware of plot devices and how to use them to good effect.</p></li><li><p>Ensure the challenges you set your Players are achievable, and that any enemies that need to be defeated can be defeated.</p></li><li><p>Intersperse some light relief into horror-heavy games.</p></li><li><p>Decide which parts of the adventure should be easy and quickly resolved, and which should be the most dramatic and challenging.</p></li><li><p>What parts of the adventure need to be successful to make the story satisfying, and how will you ensure they happen without making your players feel too railroaded?</p></li><li><p>When it comes to the results of Tests, be firm but fair.</p></li><li><p>Be ready to make a big deal of players using or gaining Fate and Resilience points.</p></li><li><p>Make a list of descriptive phrases appropriate for the locations the adventure is taking place in, to help improvised scenes.</p></li><li><p>If in doubt, err on the side of having fun.</p></li><li><p>Give Characters challenges that require improvisation or creative thinking.</p></li><li><p>You can’t detail everyone the Characters meet, but a single feature — an accent, catchphrase or tic — helps make everyone memorable!</p></li></ul><h4>Rules Notes</h4><p>As you play more games of <strong>WFRP</strong>, the rules will become increasingly familiar. To give you a head start, these points are worth initially bearing in mind:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tests</strong>: Use of the different methods of resolving actions give you considerable control over the pace of the game — use them!</p></li><li><p><strong>Fortune Points</strong>: Encourage your players to spend these during play or you will find cautious players repeatedly have several at the end of the session unused, and have probably failed some Tests they could have passed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Advantage</strong>: Advantage speeds up combat by adding momentum for winning each round. Remember all Advantage is lost when you lose a round, or if you are hit by ranged or magical attacks — Advantage is not as scary as it first appears, even if it stacks high. Should Characters become overwhelmed, they may wish to consider disengaging, then either fleeing or attacking from afar. Characters can also spend Resilience points to automatically win a round and eliminate any build-up of Advantage their foes might have secured.</p></li><li><p><strong>Opposed Tests</strong>: Almost all combat Tests are Opposed, meaning that someone always wins, even if both combatants effectively fail their individual Tests. Remember, the difference in SL will always secure a winner. This means even very poor combatants will be landing blows right from the outset — just without any skill or finesse.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Opposition</strong>: Should you find opponents who refuse to defend themselves for fear of rolling poorly in an Opposed Test, then clearly their Characters are doing nothing, meaning they count as @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#helpless-targets]{Helpless}.</p></li></ul><h3>Character Creation</h3><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/sigmarat.webp\" width=\"214\" height=\"278\" /></div><p>Before your first <strong>WFRP</strong> game begins, the Players will need to create Characters, or choose one of the ready-made characters provided on the <strong>Cubicle 7</strong> website or the <strong>WFRP Starter Set</strong>. The ready-made Characters are already formed into a group and are ready to go, but if your Players are creating their own, you should guide them through the process.</p><p>Character Creation can take a while, so it can be worth devoting the first game session to it, so let the Players know this in advance to manage their expectations. You can take Players through each step of character creation, but Players having their own rulebooks can speed things up considerably. Guide new Players through how the different parts of their Character will be used in the game, and encourage Players to coordinate their choices so they can build a broadly capable group. A good spread of Classes gives both you and the Players more options during play. If the group has no spellcasters for example, you can’t run adventures that require the Players follow magical clues.</p><p>Encourage Players to involve other Characters in their own Character’s background and provide suggestions to help. This helps bind the group together and should make it easier for them to choose a @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.2YaSdbUwpO1UaNFI#party-ambitions]{Group Ambition}. Avoid creating a group of disparate desperadoes who won’t work together and never cooperate on anything. That gets old fast and can lead to unsatisfying gaming experiences.</p><p>The group should have a reason to stick together, work together, and be motivated to engage with the adventures awaiting them. A good way to make sure the group has this is to simply ask your Players to explain exactly why their Characters work together, and why they will adventure together in future. You may be surprised at just how inventive your Players can be.</p><p>Having a good idea of the adventures you have planned means you can weave connections to them into each Character’s background. If you’ve got a smuggler in the group, and you know part of the forthcoming adventures involve a smuggling ring, work your smugglers into that Character’s background. If a Chaos Cult is central to the adventure, perhaps decide that an important member of one Character’s family will be a secret member of the cult. These personal details will make for a more involving game that really immerses the Players in the game world.</p><p>If your group are not cooperating, you can always try external motivations. For example: the promise of an incredible reward the Characters can’t resist, or being ‘asked’ to do work by a powerful patron who won’t take refusal kindly.</p><p>The Character creation phase is also a great place to discuss the kind of game everyone wants to play. Identifying content to avoid — for instance graphic violence, sex, or horror — is just as important as determining the game your Players will enjoy. Some people might not be comfortable talking about this in front of others, so make sure you give everyone the chance to communicate with you privately about it, and don’t ask for the reasons why — the preference is enough. If in any doubt, err on the side of caution, and remember the goal is for everyone to have fun.</p><h3>At the Table</h3><p>During sessions where you are running games of <strong>WFRP</strong> as the GM, here’s what you’ll be doing:</p><h4>1. Set the scene</h4><p>At the start of the game, the GM should give a summary of what has happened in the adventure so far — in the first session of an adventure this will instead be some background to the adventure about to begin. It’s the recap part of a TV series: ‘Previously on <strong>WFRP</strong>…’: keep it short and sweet.</p><p>Next, you’ll describe where the Characters are and what is happening around them. Provide immediate prompts to action — make sure that the game gets off to an exciting start. End with an event or question that means the Players have to get involved right away — even a simple knock on their door, or thrown jar of ale arcing gently across the taproom towards them immediately leads to action!</p><h4>2. Listen to the Players</h4><p>The Players will react to the scene-setting and will interpret what is going on, often in a way that us GMs would describe as ‘interesting’. As GM, you already know the plot of the adventure, but the Players will need to puzzle it out, perhaps with a false start or two. Don’t panic if they head off in the wrong direction — they’ll get there in the end, and you’ll have a lot of fun along the way.</p><p>So, resolve their immediate actions in the game while listening carefully to how they are going to react to the wider plot to give you thinking time for the next part. Make sure each Player has the opportunity to contribute — actively ask any Player who hasn’t yet participated what their Character is going to do.</p><h4>3. Describe the consequences of the Players’ actions</h4><p>You’ll react to the Player’s actions depending on what they are doing. If they are talking to one of the character’s you’ve described as being present in the scene, you’ll respond to them in the role of that person. If they are taking actions that require Tests to resolve, you’ll decide which Skill is being tested, any modifiers on the Test, and interpret the outcome — what happens because of that action. Sometimes this will be the start of a sequence of events, which other Players might join, or it may be a simple action that is quickly resolved. Again, make sure everyone has an opportunity to do something and contribute to the game. Ask quieter Players directly to make sure they get a go.</p><p>This Player-directed phase of the game can go on for quite some time, as you all take turns to move the story forward, and the GM is largely in a reactive role. Even experienced GMs can be amazed at the tangents Players can pursue, and some very memorable games come from this improvised style of play.</p><h4>4. Describe events from the ongoing plot</h4><p>While the Player-directed phase is going on, the GM will be aware of the adventure plot circling in the Aethyr. At the appropriate times, events from the plot will come crashing in. The Players will now be reacting to events before formulating their new plan and pursuing it in their inevitably haphazard style. These moments can be used as course-corrections, giving additional clues on what is really happening, and helping get Players back on track.</p><p>Be careful not to be too blunt or obvious with these events however — no-one likes to feel like they are being forced towards an inevitable conclusion. Allow Players the autonomy to really mess things up, but also don’t be afraid to modify your plot on the hoof if it makes for a more enjoyable game.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/forest.webp\" /></div><h3>Travel</h3><p>Travelling in the Old World can be dangerous. Brigands, mutants, and beasts lurk in the shadows, an ever-present threat, perhaps joined by those specifically out to thwart the Players’ actions. Some parts of the Empire have been corrupted by magic, Chaos, Necromancy, or worse, and can easily consume the unwary traveller. Even the weather poses a threat!</p><p>It’s up to you how you want to represent the dangers of travel in your game. Sometimes you’ll just want to get on with the adventure and deal with journeys with a simple description of how long the journey was, and the key points along the way. Most journeys will either be by road or by river, with road the more dangerous, and cheaper, option.</p><h4>Travel by Road</h4><p>The roads of the Reikland are often crude but reliable. The routes between major cities are relatively safe and well-maintained. However, far-flung routes can be little more than muddy tracks. Regardless of the quality, all roads need to be maintained, so most are tolled.</p><p>There is an extensive network of coach routes throughout the province. The busiest routes have coaches running several times per day. The many Coaching Houses of the Reikland are in fierce competition, so the prices are often reasonable and reliability is good. The Four Seasons is the biggest coach company, and is represented along all the major routes.</p><p>Roadside inns are often placed at the convenience of the Coaching Houses. Therefore, journeying by foot, especially away from the major routes, runs the risk of not reaching a safe place to rest before nightfall.</p><h4>Travel by River</h4><p>River journeys are often straightforward and perhaps even relaxing. However, this relies on finding a boat going to and from convenient locations. Dedicated passenger barges only travel between the major towns and cities, but can be bribed or persuaded to drop people off along the way. Getting to more obscure locations usually requires hitching a ride with a cargo boat, which can be difficult for large parties.</p><h4>Travel Prices</h4><p>The prices listed in Travel Costs do not include meals, lodging, or fodder, although coaches and passenger boats usually charge for the whole package for longer journeys. Package prices can be worked out by combining travel with food and boarding prices. On some ferries, lodging is not required, as passengers sleep on the vessel, either on deck or in a private cabin.</p><p>Cargo barge travel-costs should be individually haggled with barge masters. Often, such passage can be secured for a greatly reduced price, or even for free, if the passenger is willing to work and they know what they’re doing.</p><p>High class travel is available and de rigueur among the nobility, and can cost many times the listed price, typically ten times or more. Opulent passenger vessels ply between the great cities of the Empire, like the famous @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-dotr.scenes.aDSJw58bVEI9SqNu]{Emperor Luitpold} plying the River Talebec between Altdorf and Talabheim.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 class=\"sidebar-title\"><em>Travel Costs</em></h4><p><em>All the costs listed here are per mile travelled, and are loose guides only. Faster coaches and barges generally cost twice as much. Slower examples cost as little as half as much. Increase or decrease speed by +/– 1 for faster or slower examples. </em></p><table style=\"height:153px;width:367px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><h4><em><strong>Transport</strong></em></h4></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><h4><em><strong>Movement</strong></em></h4></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><h4><em><strong>Cost</strong></em></h4></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><h4><em><strong>Distance</strong></em></h4></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>COACH</strong></em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>6</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"> </td><td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"> </td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\">Inside</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td><td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[2bp]</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\">Outside</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td><td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[1bp]</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>BARGE</strong></em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>8</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"> </td><td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"> </td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\">Cabin</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td><td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[5bp]</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\">Deck</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"> </td><td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[2bp]</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per mile</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>CAB</strong></em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>6</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[3bp]</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per district</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:75px\"><em><strong>FERRY</strong></em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:93px;text-align:center\"><em>4</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:99px;text-align:center\"><em>@Pay[1bp]</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;width:87px;text-align:center\"><em>per 20 yards</em></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><h4>Travel Times</h4><p>Use Movement to determine travel speed in miles per hour. So, if a party’s slowest Movement was 3, it would travel at approximately 3 miles per hour.</p><p>Taking into account rests, necessary stops, and a typical topography, a party can travel the equivalent of 6 hours a day without requiring Endurance Tests. If travelling faster or farther, give a @Condition[Fatigued]{Fatigue} Condition to those failing this Test, with extra Fatigue if Encumbered (see @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.oAPLajkv4l9IlRzO#overburdened]{Encumbrance}).</p><p>Barge speed can increase or decrease by up to 30% if going downstream or upstream, as you determine is appropriate.</p><h4>Travel Events</h4><p>Whether detailing daily travel or simply choosing to allow the party to pay an appropriate fee and then arrive at their chosen destination, every now and again it’s good to throw in some travel events. It’s an opportunity to show off a different aspect of the Old World, or to give a change of pace to the adventure.</p><p>An intrigue-focused game can sometimes do with a clearly defined ‘goodies vs. baddies’ Beastmen attack. A tense, bleak session can benefit from a night’s entertainment sharing camp with a travelling circus. Further, you can work these encounters into your ongoing narrative if you wish.</p><p>Finding the burned-out caravans of the circus later in the journey is a poignant way of making the antagonists’ actions personal. Travel events are also great for foreshadowing events to come, or reinforcing the themes of an adventure.</p><p>It is up to you how much of an issue you want these travel events to be for your players. Some could simply consist of a brief description, while others could form the basis of an entire session of play. Some GMs prefer to roll [[/r 1d10 # Travel Event]] per day of travel and have an event occur on the roll of an 8 (signifying the 8-pointed symbol of Chaos — something unexpected and random has occurred), others like a single event for each journey of a day or more. This is left for you to determine, though if you are playing a printed adventure by <strong>Cubicle 7</strong> that includes a journey, suggested events and travel times will be included. So, the @UUID[RollTable.zPZbN8DOX2V1ZwWl]{Events Table} can be used as you prefer, and presumes a single event for the journey travelled.</p><p>@Table[event]{Travel Events}</p><p>You might like to give Players the opportunity to avoid nasty events with a successful Perception Test, or Outdoor Survival, or whatever other Test makes sense at the time. If they are travelling in paid-for transportation, you might decide that gives them help in overcoming any adversities.</p><h3>After the Game</h3><p>Try to end your session in a narratively satisfying way, either with a moment of resolution, revelation, mystery, or the dreaded cliffhanger, leaving your Players waiting until the next session before learning what happens to their Characters.</p><h4>Awarding XP</h4><p>At the end of every session you should award your players XP. This is your opportunity to reward your Players for cooperation, good roleplaying and making the experience fun. Remember that it’s better to use the carrot than the stick — don’t punish players who didn’t cooperate, reward those who did. People will soon get the message!</p><p>Additional bonuses of 25-50 XP could be awarded for excellent roleplaying, teamwork, or otherwise getting in the spirit of things. If you are playing a published adventure from <strong>Cubicle 7</strong>, it will list suggested XP awards for every session.</p><h4>Recovering Fate and Resilience</h4><p>A Player spending a point of Fate or Resilience is a significant event. Characters generally have few of these points, and they are powerful, so they should be spent wisely. After all, spending Fate or Resilience will also reduce the number of Fortune and Resolve points a character has available.</p><p>Awarding Players Fate and Resilience points is likewise a rare and special occurrence.

High Elves commonly give reports on interesting things they’ve learned to agents of Ulthuan in either Altdorf or Marienburg, whereas Asrai do the same with the spies from their arboreal homes.

So, if you have a lot of money spare it may be worth a trip to the bank. If you are using a <em>Banking</em> Endeavour to retain your money, you must first decide whether to save your money by investing it with a reputable banking institution, or to stash it somewhere less secure. </p><p><strong>Investing</strong>: You must be of the Gold and Silver social tiers to save with a banking house. Your money will be reasonably safe and it should accrue interest. When undertaking a <em>Banking</em> Endeavour to deposit money in a bank, determine the interest rate of your account, by choosing a number between 1 and 10 (alternatively you may simply roll [[/r 1d10 # Interest Roll]]). This is the rate of interest you will accrue, and also how risky the investment is. Withdrawing funds requires another <em>Banking</em> Endeavour. This may take place immediately after the initial Endeavour, or after subsequent adventures have occurred. Roll [[/r 1d100 # Bank Roll]]: if you roll equal to or less than your rate of interest, the venture has gone bankrupt and you have lost all of your money. If you roll over the interest rate, you receive your initial funds, plus the interest accrued. </p><p><strong>Stashing</strong>: All characters may choose to stash their loot. This is a risky strategy, involving hiding it on your person, in your mattress, or burying it somewhere. Stashed money never accrues any interest. Players may withdraw money from a stash before the start of an adventure, without undertaking an Endeavour.

The symbol of the Sixth Lore is the scythe and its wizards wear purple robes.</p>\n<p>Wizards of the Amethyst Order are shunned by common folk and there is reason to see why. Even so there are many who secretly crave contact with the spirit world, with departed loved ones or those dead souls whose secrets they wish to learn. Amethyst Wizards can contact the dead, for they have mastery over spirits both benign and otherwise.</p>\n<p>It is said that they have the power to bend the dead to their will. Such tricks are as nothing compared to the nightmarish sorceries of the Undead, yet they are of a similar nature, and the Amethyst Wizards are tainted by their association with Necromancy, no matter how distant they claim it to be.</p>\n<p>As the wizards of the Amethyst Order have power over the dead, they too have the power to deal death. It is said that an Amethyst Wizard can suck the life from an enemy, leaving nought but a husk. They can cast a wind of death that withers flesh or envelop their foes under a shroud of despair.</p>\n<p>The order’s campus is dark and sepulchral, shuttered against the light and dimly illuminated.

They blow through past, present, and future, weaving through the time stream, following the undetectable current of fate. Many say that the Wind of </em>Shyish <em>blows strongly where death lies most heavily, that its energies are drawn to death and that doom follows in its wake. It blows over battlefields and mortuaries, it clings around charnel pits and graveyards, and falls over the gibbet like a shadow.</em></p>\n<p><em>Channelling (Shyish) Tests benefit from +1 SL where many bodies are interred, or where great carnage has taken place.

Bats roost in its crooked towers and its cellars crawl with verminous creatures. The building overlooks the fabled haunted cemetery of Old Altdorf. Though the citizens of Altdorf are fully aware of where it is, none trouble the brethren of the Amethyst Order.</p>\n<h3>Semiotics of the Amethyist Order</h3>\n<p>The Amethyst College bears the scythe as their symbol, for the grim aspect of death hangs heavy about them. Wizards of this order often carry a scythe instead of a staff, and in this way they are easily recognised. They also favour designs featuring skulls and bones, the hourglass, and the thorned rose — the symbols of the grave.</p>\n<p>To be a practitioner of Death Magic is a weighty burden, for an Amethyst Wizard will never be entirely trusted by those around them. The suspicious dread is only exacerbated by the silent and sombre nature of Amethyst Wizards, who prefer to communicate with one another through telepathy, rather than speech, and whose little-used voices have tones more suited to the long-dead than the living. For this reason, the order’s scythe is always portrayed inverted, to represent a heavy burden propped against the ground.</p>\n<h3>Disiples of Death</h3>\n<p>The Amethyst College is strict in its selection of apprentices, vigilant for any hint of Necromancy, reportedly destroying without mercy those who show it. Apprentices come from all walks of life, their common trait being the ability to see Shyish and its effects on the world. Not a few are former clergy of Morr who, unlike their colleagues, could see gossamer shreds of <em>Shyish</em> floating through their ceremonies. Others are battlefield survivors who saw some of their comrades as corpses — before they died. The discord this causes in their lives harms the apprentice’s social status until they learn to discipline it and become a magister.</p>\n<p>If the apprentice survives their training, their life as a magister becomes one of study, research, and contemplation, usually alone. Even within the confines of the Amethyst College, the magisters rarely socialise, preferring to work in their crypt-like laboratories alone, or with an apprentice or two. There are few large lectures, and training takes place in whispered tones.</p>\n<p>Amethyst magisters cannot wholly withdraw from the world, however. Their duty under the Imperial Charter requires them to venture out into the world to investigate mysteries or deal with threats, such as the Undead or Necromancy. Magisters may also travel to gain experience, often seeking out ruins, tombs, battlefields, and other places of death. With the difficulty many have dealing with outsiders, the Amethyst magister often travels with more social types — ‘friends’ not being quite the right description — letting them deal with mundane affairs while the magister concentrates on the problem at hand.</p>\n<h3>Relationships</h3>\n<h4>The Jade Order</h4>\n<p>There is an unexpected friendship between the Amethyst and @UUID[JournalEntry.Q9sQhbDN8NUHXYdA.JournalEntryPage.ncaIbmNtJrNfVfZh]{Jade Orders}, deathly <em>Shyish</em> allied with vibrant <em>Ghyran</em>. Perhaps it is because both are concerned with transition — from potential to birth and growth for the druids, to age, decay, and death for the brethren of <em>Shyish</em> — but each feels a sympathy for the other, an attraction of opposites. Their two patriarchs often ally in matters concerning the colleges, much to the others’ puzzlement. It is not uncommon to see a wizard from each travelling together, bickering like an old married couple, but working hand in glove.</p>\n<h4>The Cult of Morr</h4>\n<p>Common interest, not friendship, drives the cooperation between the college and the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon.JournalEntryPage.HfmrIexylrgxIz2x]{Cult of Morr}. Beyond their concerns with the dead — respect and protection, for the cult, and understanding for the order — both are adamant in the fight against Necromancy. Emissaries from the two regularly consult, and the order maintains shrines to Morr in the college as a sign of respect.</p>\n<p>But there is tension. Many priests of Morr suspect <em>Shyish</em> magic is disguised Necromancy and that the magisters are just deluded fools, and so the cult cooperates in order to keep a close eye on the Amethyst Order. The order, on the other hand, is so eager to prove its good faith that it sometimes invites cult officials to witness the execution of fallen members, which unfortunately reinforces those suspicions.</p>\n<p>It is not a surprise, then, that some priests of Morr are hostile to the order, convinced that the magisters are blasphemers. A secret brotherhood of fanatics, the Order of the Raven’s Claw, sometimes takes direct, fatal action against magisters. Though formally banned and suppressed by Morr’s hierarchy as heretical, it is rumoured to have many members among the priesthood and devout laypeople.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img style=\"margin-top:-20px\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/morr.webp\" width=\"269\" height=\"322\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Purple Wind","type":"text","_id":"M8Bj02p51RqAGn3m","title":{"show":true,"level":3},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Popular folklore fearfully associates <em>Shyish</em>, the Purple Wind, with death and graves and the horrors of the Undead, which is a misconception… mostly.</p><p>The Magister of <em>Shyish</em> would rather say that the Purple Wind, while associated with death and concerned with the Undead, is the wind of transition, time, and memory. Whereas a Magister of <em>Chamon</em> seeks to understand alchemical transformation, changing one substance into another, an Amethyst Wizard studies the transitions of the body as it ages, or the essence of life as it moves on from this world. And whereas magisters of <em>Ghyran</em> study life as it begins and grows full, the students of <em>Shyish</em> contemplate it as it ages and ends with time.</p><p>Most Amethyst Magisters see <em>Shyish</em> not as a blowing wind of colour, but dark purple fragments of corpse-shrouds drifting on a slow-moving breeze in a desultory, melancholy manner. Some say that, as they watch from the windows of the college, they can see these patches of <em>Shyish</em> brush up against a person or a building, flowing over and enveloping them in a purplish glimmer that only the magister can see. As the wizard watches, they glimpse the ageing and decay of the subject, the inevitable fate the future holds for all.</p><p>It is not surprising then that <em>Shyish</em> has an affinity for death, gathering most strongly where death has taken place or will soon — battlefields, graveyards, and execution sites. It lies heavy on ruins, those ‘corpses’ of buildings and civilisations that once teemed with life. Something about the presence of <em>Shyish</em> leaves a record within Time, and so those sensitive to the Purple Wind can sometimes view fragments of the past, like a painting that has faded and grown patchy. Thus <em>Shyish</em> is a wind of sombre melancholy, carrying the burden of what was lost and resignation to what will be lost. It is this sense of gloom that so affects magisters of Shyish, encouraging them toward quiet contemplation and giving them their dour reputation.</p><p><em>Shyish</em> is also the wind of existence after death. Rather than fear it, they see it as another state of being within the Purple Wind’s flow through Time, which they accept with equanimity. It is even rumoured that, when <em>Shyish</em> blows strong, magisters who have ‘crossed’ can return to the college for a time to visit old colleagues and even conduct lectures. The order denies this, however, fearing charges of Necromancy.</p><h3>The Amethyst College</h3><p>The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.fdJoVarskd5N7VJ9]{Amethyst College} is the heart of the order, though locals sometimes wonder if that heart beats. A massive structure of dark stone, more like a mausoleum than a place of learning, it squats in Altdorf ’s @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.LqyTrO7VNeMDukKY]{Hexxerbezrik} district next to the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.DHks3ARe0UQkVZPy]{Haunted Cemetery}. From it rise towers and garretts with narrow windows, all ending in peaked roofs, from the eaves of which clouds of bats fly out and swirl in the sky at sunset.</p><p>Altdorfers living nearby say they rarely see anyone coming or going from the College, though its main doors are open all hours. These are great panels of patina-streaked bronze decorated with embossed skulls, scythe-wielding figures of Death, and scenes of mourning, all entwined with rose vines, the flower associated with <em>Shyish</em>. Callers at the College stop at the doors and ring an ancient bronze bell — entry is forbidden to the uninvited. A silent porter comes to either take a message, or conduct the visitor inside, if they have an appointment.</p><p>Children sneaking inside on a dare tell of empty halls draped in cobwebs, tattered hangings of purple and black, broken windows streaked with grime, and dust everywhere. Other than the occasional dried husk of a rat or a bat, there is no sign of life. Intruders feel an oppressive atmosphere, both an overwhelming melancholy and a sense of being watched. Inevitably it becomes unbearable, and the explorer who stealthily crept in comes running out.</p><p>For residents and invited guests, the interior is still sombre, but clearly inhabited. Fine furnishings of dark wood, marble, and porphyry are bathed in a lavender light from stained glass windows or hanging lamps. Portraits of senior magisters and former patriarchs line the walls.</p><p>Visitors have noted well-maintained shrines to Morr, though no magister is ever seen worshipping at one. One can even encounter a magister or apprentice in the halls, though they rarely speak, and the college itself seems to prevent talk above a gentle whisper.</p><p>Many speculate about the nature of the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.fdJoVarskd5N7VJ9]{Amethyst College}, but facts are few. Some dismiss the stories as wild tales children use to scare each other. Others suspect something else, that concentrated <em>Shyish</em> may take the building and its inhabitants ‘out of phase’ with the material world, leaving behind a husk. The idea that the Purple Wind itself could be sentient and know the intentions of others is a thought few like to consider.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/undead-fight.webp\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Elspeth von Draken","type":"text","_id":"KHdKVGnogfOfcGcA","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/actors/elspeth-von-draken.webp\" width=\"306\" height=\"349\" /></div><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.oldtgeL8W8JqlmMA]{Elspeth von Draken}</p><p>Elspeth von Draken hails from an ancient family touched by the Winds of Magic, a bloodline that has produced both monsters and saviours down the centuries. She is so saturated with the force of <em>Shyish</em> that she stands halfway between life and death and can become an insubstantial spectre, leading the folk of Nuln to whisper that she should hardly be thought of as human.</p><p>She has little to do with the political affairs of the Colleges of Magic. Whilst she holds fealty to them in theory, she keeps to herself and ignores their summons. She is a compulsive experimenter and mystic who holds her own agenda and jealously guards a private collection of magical artefacts and lore. Despite her apparent indifference she is a valiant scion of the Empire and a bane to its foes. She has bound to her will a great Carmine Dragon which can, in its wrath, unleash blasts of amaranthine lightning. Despite her refusal to cooperate with the Colleges of Magic she does have long standing pacts with the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon.JournalEntryPage.HfmrIexylrgxIz2x]{Cult of Morr} and has sworn to @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-empire-ruins.actors.CcqiAghkzgp9u1In]{Emmanuelle von Liebwitz} to come to Nuln’s aid in war.  </p><p>Supreme Patriarch @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.actors.wkR7O1KYE9qaXntF]{Thyrus Gormann} regards von Draken’s independence as a liability and resents her enigmatic manners and evident power. He has dispatched agents to inform him of her activities. To his frustration they have not provided him with information that might compromise von Draken but have reported on several conflicts where she vanquished monsters. She slew the Mire Hulk Rawbones, who demanded a bloody tribute in young lives from the villages along the River Sol.</p><p>She destroyed Vashara of Lahmia before the Vampire could corrupt the noble Jaegersbruk family of Pfeildorf and drag the city into a shadow realm of undeath.</p><p>While @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.oldtgeL8W8JqlmMA]{Elspeth von Draken} remains aloof, the Supreme Patriarch can do no more than watch and brood, but there are those beneath him in the hierarchy of wizards who fear that his paranoid obsession with the Graveyard Rose leads inexorably towards a deadly confrontation.</p><h4>Elspeth von Draken</h4><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.oldtgeL8W8JqlmMA]{Elspeth} is a solitary individual who possesses a singular — some might say selfish — drive. She seeks to make herself so powerful that she no longer has to worry about earthly ties, so she does not make for an easy patron and takes on no apprentices.</p><p>There are a couple of ways a Character might, nevertheless, gain her attention.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.oldtgeL8W8JqlmMA]{Elspeth} needs the support of the rulers of Nuln, for the time being. She maintains close relationships with the court of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-empire-ruins.actors.CcqiAghkzgp9u1In]{Emmanuelle von Liebwitz} in order to afford her allies in the case of the Colleges of Magic making moves to force her to take her obligations to them more seriously and share more of her findings. If a Character were to win the favour of Emmanuelle she would be able to ask Elspeth to grant them an audience. However, Emmanuelle would not make this request lightly (she benefits from keeping Elspeth happy, after all) so she would have to be very impressed by the Character before agreeing to do so. Even so, Elspeth would not take the request kindly and the Character would have to work hard to win her over even if she were obliged to meet them.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.oldtgeL8W8JqlmMA]{Elspeth} may be moved were she to meet a like-minded wizard who also had differences with the Colleges of Magic. If a Character is clearly a competent wizard, has a good track record of defying the enemies of the Empire, and is open in their opinion that their obligations to the colleges stifle them, then Elspeth might be willing to offer them sanctuary and tuition. Even so she will not offer them patronage for long, Elspeth respects people who learn to look after themselves.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.oldtgeL8W8JqlmMA]{Elspeth} can help in several Endeavours the Character might perform.

{"name":"GM's Guide","pages":[{"name":"What Makes Warhammer?","type":"text","_id":"Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Whilst it’s one thing to know how to GM the systems of <strong>WFRP</strong>, it’s another thing entirely to know how to GM the world. To help with this vital part of roleplaying, we’ve outlined goals to follow, and a set of principles to help you choose between multiple courses of action.</p><p>The goals and principles are used in similar ways by many roleplaying games to help GMs answer the question ‘<em>What should happen next?</em>’ These tools are designed to help novice-to-experienced GMs align themselves with <strong>WFRP</strong>, and to think critically about the kind of experience they want their Players to have.</p><p>These tools are not prescriptive. If you don’t follow them, you’re not playing the game ‘wrong’. But we encourage you to be open to trying them out — you may find they suit your group well!</p><p>Lastly, this section details the thematic pillars that hold up Warhammer, and give some guidance on how to accentuate and focus on individual themes over the course of your campaigns.</p><h2>The GM's Goal</h2><p>The following list explains your goal as the GM, beyond that laid out in <strong>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</strong>. These four points should tell you what you’re trying to do, and why. Everything you do as a GM should serve these four goals.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\"><em>Your Goals Are</em></h3><ul><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#make-the-old-world-come-to-life]{Make the Old World come to life}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#create-gripping-and-action-packed-scenarios]{Create gripping and action-packed scenarios}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#build-a-story-together]{Build a story together}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#understand-the-characters]{Understand the Characters}.</em></p></li></ul></blockquote><h3>Make the Old World Come to Life</h3><p>You’re there to make the Old World feel real, filled with believable people and places. But the Old World is a weird and often impossible place — with Beastmen, magic, mutation, and Chaos — so your job is to ground that in reality. What does it mean to have @UUID[JournalEntry.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f.JournalEntryPage.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#second-sight]{Second Sight}? What is it really like to face a horde of ravening Greenskins?</p><h3>Create Gripping and Action-Packed Scenarios</h3><p>As a GM you’re there to inject drama and conflict into the lives of the Characters. You’re there to place walls between them and their Ambitions, and to tempt their @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.GaZa9sU4KjKDswMr#determining-motivation]{Motivations} with rewards. But Warhammer thrives on the mundane, juxtaposed with the epic. You’re there to make injury and illness exciting, to make the quest to afford one more meal, or a roof over one’s head, worthwhile.</p><h3>Build a Story Together</h3><p>You’re there to facilitate group storytelling. You’re there to share the spotlight, as evenly as possible, so everyone at the table has the opportunity to contribute. You’re not there to script the outcome of any action, but to interpret your Adventure, and the actions of your Characters.</p><h3>Understand the Characters</h3><p>You’re there to discover how the Characters are going to get through the challenges you give them. You’re there to be surprised and entertained, just like the other Players are! Don’t bother writing Adventures with balance or solutions in mind — in fact, throw your own solutions out the window. Present problems, and let your Players solve them creatively.</p><h2>The GM's Principles</h2><p>The following principles should be a guide: advice on what to do and not do in general. These aren’t specific instances of ‘<em>when X happens, do Y</em>’, but rather good ways to approach running a game of <strong>WFRP</strong>.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\"><em>The GM's Principles Are:</em></h3><ul><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#reveal-the-old-world]{Reveal the Old World}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#incorporate-the-characters]{Incorporate the Characters}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#embody-uncaring-gods]{Embody Uncaring Gods}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#evil-is-rampant,-good-is-rare]{Evil is Rampant, Good is Rare}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#focus-on-the-characters]{Focus on the Characters}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#everyone-has-a-history]{Everyone Has a History}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#lead-the-players-to-their-story]{Lead the Players to Their Story}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#be-a-friend,-and-an-enemy]{Be a Friend, and an Enemy}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#always-advance-the-story]{Always Advance the Story}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#embrace-conflict]{Embrace Conflict}</em></p></li><li><p><em>@UUID[.Zzy5fEbh0mrMxGjt#be-truthful-(to-players)]{Be Truthful (to Players)}</em></p></li></ul></blockquote><h3>Reveal the Old World</h3><p>The Old World isn’t like most fantasy lands. It is full of juxtapositions and conflicts: a middle class rising up from the oppressed peasants under the boot of the tyrannical nobility; the conflicts of doctrine between the preaching, doom-laden churches of the myriad cults; the screaming of babies with empty stomachs, drowned out by the crashing of plate armour, and the beat of drums as the Imperial Army marches by. The Old World is grim, gritty, and largely — but not entirely — without hope. Flickers of life, of happiness, and a gallows-humour peek through, which prove the indomitable spirit of Humanity, and shed light on Sigmar’s Heirs.</p><p>You should work to cultivate knowledge, not just of the Old World as described in practical terms — the towns, rivers, forests, and so on — but also the themes and imagery that make it unique. You should consume media that shows off the glory and tragedy of the Renaissance, and then flood it with monsters, and magic at its edges.</p><h3>Incorporate the Characters</h3><p>Speak directly to the Characters, not the Players. State clearly the information that would be apparent to them. Remember that we, as people, take cues from our world: smells, sounds, the way someone twitches. These cues can be wrong, disguised, or misleading, but we still take them in. The Players should interrogate a scene by using their Character’s Skills, but you should be vigilant to give that information up front — and direct it at the Characters.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>‘Hans, you can tell the woman isn’t saying what she truly feels. You can’t tell why, but she’s holding something back, and her hand keeps slipping to the belt at her waist. She’s on edge, her eyes almost pleading with you not to force her to act rashly.’</em></p><p>This passage tells us a lot more than a clinical description of what’s happening: it breaths context and emotion into the Scene, and Hans’s Player will feel it more. It’s more visceral.</p><h3>Embody Uncaring Gods</h3><p>Look through the eyes of uncaring Gods! Nothing is sacred in the Old World, when you look at it from on high. Nothing is beyond being killed, burned, maimed, or crushed. Consider always how things could get worse, and put those threats against all of your creations. No NPC is safe, no boon given to a Character is permanent.</p><p>Further, consider the malevolence of the Ruinous Powers. Always look for the failings in every Character that crosses your path. How can you tempt them? How can you corrupt them? How can you raise them up, only to bring them low again? Pull no punches.</p><h3>Evil is Rampant, Good is Rare</h3><p>Reward evil, punish the good. Crime pays. Chaos runs rampant not through the lack of heroes, but the abundance of villains. The easy way out is almost always unclean. The right thing to do comes without reward, without celebration, and often with a knife in one’s back. Look always to offer easier solutions through compromised means, and stress that the world is unkind to optimists.</p><h3>Focus on the Characters</h3><p>Despite the Old World being an awful place to be, and our Characters are frequently far from heroes, in the end the story is about them. They may not always be the focal point of the stories unfolding around them, but they are our focus for how the story is told. They are our protagonists. You should be always hoping for the best for your Players’ Characters, whilst setting threats in their path. Every Combat should be one you hope they survive. Every moment your Players are on the edges of their seats, so you should be!</p><p>But, like any good story, we can only hope if there is something threatening that hope. You are not focusing on your Characters if you fail to create appropriate challenges for them to tackle. By that same token, you do not focus on your Characters if you never let them celebrate, nor celebrate with them. You are not there to be their enemy, but to present enemies for them to — hopefully — overcome.</p><h3>Everyone Has a History</h3><p>Name everyone — give them a home and a heart. The Old World is made of regular people, not caricatures. Everyone has a name, a history, a home, and a heart. Though evil does truly exist in the Old World, it is almost always a tool to follow one’s ambitions and dreams. No one commits evil for no reason, not even the monsters of the deepest darkest places.</p><p>You should strive to give a reason for things, and for the actions of the NPCs. These need not be complex, covering multiple pages of notes, but they should exist. A good rule is to give every NPC a @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.GaZa9sU4KjKDswMr#determining-motivation]{Motivation} and at least one @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.Q4C9uANCqPzlRKFD#ambitions]{Ambition}.</p><h3>Lead the Players to Their Story</h3><p>Ask leading questions, and build on the answers. Don’t just ask, <em>‘Johann, you’re a soldier, do you have any scars?’</em> but rather <em>‘Johann, who gave you your worst scar, and how does that memory haunt you to this day?’</em> The latter invites creativity far more than the former. It gives agency to a Player to describe their Character in depth. Further, the answers should be used by you at a later point to give weight to a Scene. Perhaps Johann got his scar from a Beastman’s axe? Later, maybe Johann finds a body in the forest, with wounds made by an axe that shares an uncomfortable similarity to his own scar…</p><p>These questions can also be used to disclaim decision making, granting the authority to the Players. If they ask, <em>‘Is there a chandelier in this room that I can swing off of ?’</em> you could answer <em>‘Yes,’ ‘No,’</em> or better yet, <em>‘There wouldn’t normally be, but why don’t you tell me why there is?’</em> These sorts of leading, disclaimed questions allow the Players to share in the world, and make it feel like their own.</p><h3>Be a Friend, and an Enemy</h3><p>Give with one hand, and take with the other. Warhammer isn’t about getting what you want. Or rather, it’s about getting what you want at horrendous cost. With every inch of ground the Characters claim, new problems, threats, and scars are sure to arise. They should pay for every victory in blood — often that of their enemies, but their own is very much on the line. Even simple things, like moving one rung up the social ladder, means someone else is displaced, and another enemy joins the fight against the Characters.</p><h3>Always Advance the Story</h3><p>Move off-screen, in the shadows. Whilst the story is about the Characters, it doesn’t revolve around them. Keep the action flowing in the background. Have your NPCs act without regard for the Characters; living their own lives, pursuing their own Ambitions. Don’t be afraid to ambush the Characters, or to have opportunities pass them by. The Old World isn’t waiting for them to solve its problems, but is driving full steam ahead toward the drop-off. If the Characters don’t get in the road, or try to change tracks, it’s gone — as it should be.</p><p>This might mean that the Characters lose sometimes, or that they don’t have time to solve every problem. That’s perfect. In the real world, no one person has time to do everything, and can only act on their priorities. In the Old World, we can call our priorities our Ambitions — everything else has to fend for itself.</p><h3>Embrace Conflict</h3><p>Trust your Characters to create their own conflict. You rarely have to challenge the Characters directly to create conflict — trust in the @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.GaZa9sU4KjKDswMr#determining-motivation]{Motivations} and @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.Q4C9uANCqPzlRKFD#ambitions]{Ambitions} of the Characters. Create situations that threaten those Ambitions, and promise Motivations, and your Players will get themselves into conflict. The best Adventures are ones the Characters choose to undertake themselves, so your job is to let them do that.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img style=\"transform:scaleX(-1)\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/minotaur.webp\" width=\"219\" height=\"248\" /></div><h3>Be Truthful (to Players)</h3><p>Speak truth to Players, speak lies to Characters. Never lie to your Players. Ever. But never tell your Characters the whole truth. This means being frank with your Players: tell them, right at the start, that not everything they’re told will be true. But when your Players ask a question — when they use their Skills to interrogate a scene — be truthful with the information they gain. If they succeed on their Perception Test, tell them truthfully what they find. If they fail on their Intuition Test, tell them what they truthfully believe. Make sure your Players know the difference between their knowledge, and the knowledge of their Characters. Make them understand the difference between those truths.</p><h2>The Themes of Warhammer</h2><p><strong>WFRP</strong> focuses on the following five themes. The conflicts created by these five themes can fuel almost any Adventure. And ultimately, these themes coalesce into the main looming peril of the setting: <em>The End Times</em>.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\"><em>Your Goals Are</em></h3><ul><li><p><em>Class Struggle — Rich vs Poor</em></p></li><li><p><em>Ideology — Order vs Chaos</em></p></li><li><p><em>Modernisation — Urban vs Rural</em></p></li><li><p><em>Factionalism — Us vs Them</em></p></li><li><p><em>Religion — Cult vs Cult</em></p></li></ul></blockquote><h3>Class Struggle</h3><p>Class struggle underpins a lot of the Empire — rich vs poor. Given <strong>WFRP</strong> is focused on the everyday lives turned grim adventures of Imperial citizens, it is one that is seen everywhere. The poor under classes are constantly being pushed around by the rich upper class. The burgeoning middle class is driving a wedge between the two and making both, in many ways, redundant. Wealth, once clutched in the hands of the elite, is being hoarded by those who were born peasants, or whose parents worked the fields in serfdom. This struggle brings revolutionaries, agitators, criminals, and tyrants on to the centre stage, and helps feed into the conflicts presented in all four other major themes.</p><ul><li><p>Herr Dohrmann is a ‘merchant’ in the ‘very short-term loan’ business. Dohrmann is always looking for a ‘few steady hands’ to collect on his overdue accounts, occasionally with some violent interest. Characters working for Dohrmann soon find themselves collecting purses of silver from folk living in muddy hovels, while conversely stripping destitute nobles of their still-valuable, if faded, garments.</p></li><li><p>Roswitha Sprenge is a malcontent demanding better treatment for the dockworkers of Kemperbad. While some of her points are valid, when the local merchant council actually tried to address her complaints, she immediately brought up new grievances and her rhetoric turned violent. The merchants want to know if she is an agitator with a grudge or a paid agent of nobles seeking to destabilize the freistadt.</p></li><li><p>There is nothing to be done. The Baron Meinhard Tussen-Hochen is clearly within his rights to punish his peasants that fail to meet their grain quotas. That he should choose to hunt down and slaughter entire families via horseback with Blackpowder weapons is also his right. His fellow nobles will not intervene, the merchants cannot, and the commoners dare not. Will the Characters act or turn away?</p></li></ul><h3>Ideology</h3><p>Ideology is perhaps the main theme of Warhammer, but exists as a backdrop in the Empire — outside the walls is the untamed wilderness, filled with monsters and the hordes of Chaos, whilst inside them is the order of civilisation. This is, at least, how the powers that be in the Empire want it to seem, but everything exists in a liminal space between the two — Order vs Chaos. Mutants and Beastmen exist as clear evidence that it’s not black and white. Wizards represent Chaos-turned-Order. The barbarism of Witch Hunters, nominally agents of Order, is nothing short of Chaotic. The ever-present Chaos cultists — the dreaded Enemy Within — are everywhere in the Empire. This struggle is what eventually breaks the Old World in half, and leads to the End Times.</p><ul><li><p>The Characters are hired by faithful Shallyans to act as guards for the compassionate Doktor Carsta Velsinger, a gifted physician who administers to the poor for a pittance, but is in danger of being overrun by her many frantic would-be patients, and eliminated by agents of other less empathetic doktors who would see her ‘removed’. The real question, though, is what will the Characters do when they discover she is a mutant?</p></li><li><p>Two whole villages burned, all their folk executed, for ‘heresy and acts of sedition against the Empire’ by the Witch Hunter Lothar Rieger — a man that everyone fervently praises, so long as his attention is turned elsewhere. Now, he has apparently set his sights on a village that holds friends and family of the Characters. Does Rieger even believe in innocence, or is he an agent of Chaos, unwitting or otherwise?</p></li><li><p>While travelling by coach through @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.UqeZNqbpV8uocCUN]{the Reikwald}, the Characters are waylaid by a large motley band but promised, in Ranald’s name, that no harm will come to them. It seems that the Outlaw Judge Jirl Strauchrichter needs some ‘objective’ jurists to help with the trial of some bandits who may have turned to Chaos and preying on their fellows. The Characters may learn some strange new ideas from Strauchrichter, who was named an Outlaw because he has odd notions, like people should be considered innocent until proven guilty.</p></li></ul><h3>Modernisation</h3><p>The Empire is in a state of industrialisation and innovation. Modernisation stretches out beyond the towns into the country increasing tensions — urban vs rural. The printing press puts reading and writing, once the purview of a select few, into the hands of commoners and pamphleteers. Black powder gives the power of the warrior elite to anyone who can point a metal tube at their neighbour and pull the trigger. Innovations in agriculture and manufacturing are seeing a glut of resources flowing into urban centres, which are becoming increasingly separate from their rural dependants. And the advances made in land and sea travel are making what was once a world of isolated pockets of civilisation into… something else. This, of course, brings resentment, and draws a far starker line between the other conflicts. Two peasants may be of the same status, but one can read, has travelled the world, and has seen the face of the Emperor, whilst the other knows only a pitchfork, immediate family, and the plot of land they are forced to work.</p><ul><li><p>Professor Glockauer of the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.85UN6bKPTfGEBtBb.JournalEntryPage.HYkHeQZtD2AML3oG]{Imperial Engineers’ School} of Altdorf has announced that he will soon unveil a radical new invention — a farming machine able to harvest whole fields in minutes. A group of Village Elders, concerned they may soon be rendered obsolete, hires the Characters to subtlety sabotage the machine so it will fail spectacularly when displayed.</p></li><li><p>During a recent border skirmish between provinces, the Knights of the Sacred Flame suffered a disastrous defeat when a number of their fellows were gunned down by State Troop Handgunners. Their incensed Grand Master Feutchwanger has declared Blackpowder weapons should no longer be wielded by commoners and has already drawn many nobles sympathetic to his view. The Characters are hired by Nuln agents to convince him otherwise, or ‘remove’ him, if necessary.</p></li><li><p>The Apothecary Anja Schwann has systematically expanded her business by making generic medicines using a ‘production line’ of workers. Her drugs aren’t nearly as effective as ones made following traditional ways, but they are far cheaper. The Dwarf Herbalist Kallon Rosewarden is furious with Schwann, both for abasing his work and for her business’ voracious despoiling of the herbs he needs. He hires the Characters to replace a few of Schwann’s medicines with some concoctions of his own.</p></li></ul><h3>Factionalism</h3><p>Warhammer is filled with factions that operate under an us vs them mentality — the Elves vs the Dwarfs, the Empire vs Bretonnia, Reiklanders vs Middenlanders, Altdorfers vs Ubersreikers… Identity is everything, and unswerving allegiance to such, and the conflicts that that allegiance causes, are integral. As are the juxtapositions, stereotypes, and exceptions to that rule. Consider the stories told through the stubbornness of Dwarfs and Elves attempting to work together, or a Dwarf Slayer’s unlikely growing respect for an inexperienced Manling agitator. Often this theme is set against a backdrop of ridiculousness and farce — the conflicts are there, but if everyone just set aside their differences, things would go much smoother. And yet, there’s always someone ready to stoke those fires once more, and unpick any steps towards progress.</p><ul><li><p>Trouble’s brewing on the docks as the Halfling Gaffers Guild recently started having their Ogre labourers haul all their building materials, bypassing the Human Stevedore Guild. The Halflings say they’ve done this because the Stevedores regularly overcharge them, while the Stevedores claim the Halflings unfairly demand that they haul as much as the Ogres can, at just as quick a pace. Both sides want the Characters’ help against the other, with each implying the real problem is just prejudice from the other side.</p></li><li><p>The infamous bandit Gerlach the Gouger has finally been caught, but what should be a cause for celebration has turned nasty. As Gerlach was apprehended at a river crossing, patrols of both Road Wardens and Riverwardens are now claiming the collar, along with the heavy prize purse for catching the cruel Gouger. A fight is imminent, will the Characters help negotiate or grab the Gouger for themselves during the scuffle?</p></li><li><p>The Jade Wizard Kistiane Brockdorf is tired of the endless suspicion she receives at the local market, the aggression of the Watch, and the relentless attention of the Witch Hunter Armin Geringliebe. She decides to give a series of free talks wherein she discusses the role of Wizards in the Empire and shows off a little useful Jade magic, so she hires the Characters to ‘occupy’ the Witch Hunter. The Characters soon discover that Geringliebe is anxious to attend each lecture but, strangely enough, desperate to prevent other Witch Hunters from doing so. It couldn’t be that he’s smitten with the beautiful Druid, could it?</p></li></ul><h3>Religion</h3><p>The Cults of the Empire’s religions are beset on all sides — fighting Chaos, monsters, magic, heresy, and each other: cult vs cult. Whether it’s Ulricans vs Sigmarites, Ulricans vs Taalites, Verenans vs Rhyans, or any other combination of conflicts, the Cults of the Empire are at each other's throats. Furthermore, the Cults are as political as any other group, and often more so than most. This leads to constant infighting, schisming, purges, synods, and other falling-outs among the Faithful. This constant squabbling from supposedly enlightened folk is a perfect symbol of the futility of the Warhammer world. The Gods may or may not be watching over us. They may or may not care what’s happening. Sure, they send us Miracles and Chosen to aid us in times of darkness… but they do nothing to keep their own houses in order, and show no signs of steering their own clergy.</p><ul><li><p>The poor folk of Geetberg are desperate, for a plague has afflicted them all, but the medicine needed to cure it is more costly than they can afford. A Priest of Ranald has a solution — use the silver coins interred on the eyes of the dead to save the living, but the Priests of Morr have forbidden it. Are the Characters up for some ‘noble’ graverobbing?</p></li><li><p>Captain Rainer Brusdal of Middenland is offering gold to any mercenaries willing to join the final assault of a heavily fortified bandit stronghold in the Drakwald Forest. The attack will be near-suicidal as his martial advisor, Brother Ansgar, has rejected the cunning battle plan of Sister Dacia of Myrmidia as cowardly, though it would likely save many lives, in favour of an open forward assault to honour Ulric. The Sister’s plan doesn’t need many warriors though…</p></li><li><p>A Warrior Priest of Sigmar, Father Helmut, has tried and convicted a squad of soldiers for failing to obey orders and abandoning their duty guarding one of Sigmar’s temples. Father Helmut doesn’t care that their town was on fire, or that lives were at stake — orders are orders. The Verenan Lorekeeper Irmgard will not let this injustice pass and, despite the potential ramifications, seeks to hire some brave souls to spirit the soldiers away before their execution.</p></li></ul><h3>The End Times?</h3><p>Agitators, seers, and the insane have been declaring the end of the world for many centuries, without seeming effect, but the recent auguries are the most accurate yet. It seems the long-dreaded End Times may be at hand. What does it mean to adventure in a world seemingly headed for inevitable destruction? Are the Characters’ actions still important, or is the very notion of ‘heroics’ meaningless in the face of a looming apocalypse?</p><p>Questions such as these are fundamental to the Warhammer experience, and are one of the main reasons why the focus for <strong>WFRP</strong> is on everyday people. We tell stories about a group of largely ordinary folks marked out for something extraordinary, and then get to see what happens. Will they learn of the pending doom? Will they stand against it? Will they be brought low and succumb to their baser instincts?</p><p>We can’t answer these questions, nor would we, if we could. If each Campaign is built around answering a question, then <em>all</em> <strong>WFRP</strong> Campaigns together are ultimately about these questions. As the GM, it’s worth presenting these questions and this theme, behind many threats, if the Characters dig deep enough.</p><p>But the Old World is not without hope, nor without heroism. It’s up to your Players to decide how their Characters face the coming apocalypse and if, ultimately, they can avert it.</p><ul><li><p>A blind mystic accosts a Rogue Character on the street, seizes their arm, and whispers, ‘<em>You will be the one to fulfil the Architect’s Plan, but it is not too late, turn back! Abandon this course while you still can!’ </em>The mystic then suddenly looks frightened and runs away. The Character is soon approached with several intriguing job offers, all of which sound very lucrative, involving thefts of holy relics. That night, they hear about an inexplicable fire that only took the life of one old witch…</p></li><li><p>It is an open secret that the number of mutant births is on the rise, as are instances of spontaneous mutation. The Lady Silk Shein’s sideline business involving barber-surgeons removing ‘unwanted growths’ and ‘relocating sadly stunted babes’ is booming. She offers the Characters an exceedingly generous retainer to work for her. The job includes eliminating anyone interested in stopping the mutations or seeking their source. After all, can’t let a looming apocalypse interfere with the bottom line.</p></li><li><p>Word has slipped out that in a small village deep in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.UqeZNqbpV8uocCUN]{Reikwald}, a child has been born with birthmarks that resemble both the Twin-Tailed Comet and the dreaded Star of Chaos. Old prophecies speak of such a child, saying that they are marked for great and terrible purpose during the End Times. Now, multiple factions seek to hire the Characters to kidnap the child, protect the child, eliminate the child, etc. Whatever course they choose, someone powerful will be furious with them.</p></li></ul><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/flagellants.webp\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"name":"Running The Game","type":"text","_id":"UUsaEoElyX680kEX","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><strong>Running the Game</strong> is filled with miscellania — various bits and pieces of advice on a number of topics touched on in <strong>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</strong>. Use these rules and tools to expand upon those presented in the core book as you see fit.</p><h2>Advantage</h2><p>Advantage is a powerful tool in Combat, and in more ways than you might think. Whilst there is the obvious steamroller effect of gaining more and more +10 bonuses to Tests during Combat, the presence of the mechanic itself changes the tide of battle. Below are a few tips on how to use the Advantage system to its fullest, to get the most out of Combat encounters.</p><h3>Tracking Advantage</h3><p>There are several methods for tracking Advantage that take the burden off your back, and cut down on bookkeeping.</p><p>The following are our favourite examples:</p><ul><li style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><p><strong><s>Coins and Tokens</s></strong><s>: Allow the Players to take and return the coins as they gain and lose Advantage.</s></p></li><li style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><p><strong><s>Dice</s></strong><s>: Place a 10-sided die near each miniature or on the Character Sheet, using it to track total Advantage.</s></p></li><li style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><p><strong><s>Food</s></strong><s>: Just like coins or tokens, but edible!</s></p></li><li style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><p><strong><s>Sliding Scale</s></strong><s>: Write the numbers 0 through 10 on your Character Sheets or an index card. Set a paper clip at ‘0’ so that the number is visible. Slide the paper clip up and down as you gain or lose Advantage.</s></p></li><li><p><strong>Virtual Tabletop</strong>: Most virtual tabletop platforms allow Players to set several numerical scales over their digital miniature. You can designate one of these to represent Advantage.</p></li></ul><h3>Removing Advantage</h3><p>Whilst it’s great when you have Advantage on your side, the tables can turn very quickly in <strong>WFRP</strong>, and before you know it, your opponents have built up deadly momentum. When overwhelming Advantage is accrued, it can seem impossible to overcome it. Here are three broad tips for removing Advantage.</p><h4>Ranged Combatants</h4><p>Ranged attacks cannot be Opposed unless performed at Point Blank Range or the target wields a shield, which means that no amount of Advantage will help a Character avoid losing Wounds! Make sure to place a few Creatures with ranged attacks in Combat scenes, and have them target the Characters who are building momentum the most. However, keep in mind that because ranged attacks aren’t Opposed, successfully hitting an opponent with a ranged attack doesn’t generate Advantage.</p><h4>Passive Damage</h4><p>Passive Damage is any source of Wound loss that isn’t defended against, such as from the @Condition[Ablaze], @Condition[Bleeding], or @Condition[Poisoned] Conditions. Whilst some of these Conditions would involve Tests where Advantage would be relevant (such as dodging a thrown @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.trappings.vI0oorwbZdlszudf]{Incendiary}, or parrying a poisoned blade) there are other ways to inflict these Conditions: employ the terrain, use Long Range, or target a Character’s non-combat Skills, such as Endurance.</p><h4>Retreat</h4><p>Remember that a combatant loses 1 Advantage per Round if they failed to accrue any extra Advantage during that Round, or they end the Round outnumbered. Which means, if things are going badly for a combatant, they should try to put distance between themselves and their potential killer. @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.bdfiyhEYtKs7irqc#fleeing]{Fleeing} is one option, but it’s not the only one. Consider the location where the Combat is taking place, and see if there are any ways to create barriers between combatants — throwing tables and chairs in the way, setting the ground on fire, and cutting the ropes suspending a bridge, are just a few examples.</p><p>With a bit of creativity, and by thinking about the Scene where the Combat takes place, you and your Players can use Advantage as an inspiring feature of the system, rather than a snowballing problem to overcome. Remember that, whilst the Characters in the story wouldn’t call it Advantage, they would be aware of momentum in a fight, and would try to be creative on the battlefield themselves to mitigate bad odds.</p><h3>Creatures Without the Weapon Trait</h3><p>Some Creatures such as the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.FmEDHnfAe2iIugpt]{Bog Octopus} in <strong>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</strong> or the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua1.actors.uh6p3jclCNX8C7RD]{Young Stirpike} in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua1.journals.FQW8EIplgUDGyVMj]{Ubersreik Adventures: If Looks Could Kill} lack a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.AtpAudHA4ybXVlWM]{Weapon} Creature Trait, but have in its place the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.pLW9SVX0TVTYPiPv]{Bite}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.UnJ25lL8aUzem5JO]{Tail}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.4xF7M6ylIiGntekh]{Tentacles}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.JzeN9MZ0xUDvpE2l]{Vomit}, and other such Traits that use Advantage as a cost. These Traits, without the Weapon Trait, mean that the Creature can’t perform normal attacks, and must use their special attacks if they want to defeat an opponent.</p><p>This is entirely intentional, and allows these Creatures to be played in truly unorthodox ways, which encourages more dynamic Combat. You should consider the full range of methods for gaining @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#advantage]{Advantage} to aid in these situations. @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.bdfiyhEYtKs7irqc#charging]{Charging}, for example, is a good tactic to use when immediately followed by a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.pLW9SVX0TVTYPiPv]{Bite}. Also remember that larger Creatures do not need to Disengage, so they may Charge, Bite, and move away freely.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/spot-glove-blade.webp\" width=\"213\" height=\"188\" /></div><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Advantage in Large Combats</em></h3><p><em>The Advantage system works well when there are only a handful of combatants, but it quickly becomes unmanageable when there are ten or more Characters and Creatures all fighting together. In such situations, here are two approaches that work well:</em></p><ul><li><p><em>Convert multiple Creatures into a Swarm. The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.E2Es82TvBKa7CoDG]{Swarm} rules are purposefully vague enough that they can be applied to any group of combatants, whether they are actually swarming creatures like rats, or just a rabble of peasants. Two Swarms of Clanrats backed up by a single @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.VfJgGmCTWqb0IDSW]{Rat Ogre} is a much more manageable encounter than managing 20 @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.F1vAZZcmVKkRw8xn]{Clanrats} individually.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Use Group Advantage. When there are multiple combatants working together as a group, you may abstract their Advantage into one single pool of Advantage that they all use. When you do this, generate Advantage as normal, but with a limit of Initiative Bonus gained per Round of combat, regardless of the source. Additionally, whenever a member of the group would lose all of their Advantage, the group loses 2 instead, keeping the remainder.</em></p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: The Characters are fighting six Goblins, and the GM decides to use Group Advantage. The Goblins have an Initiative Bonus of 2, so can generate a maximum of 2 Advantage as a group per Round. On the first Round, three of the Goblins charge the Characters. Normally, each would generate 1 Advantage, but instead, they generate 3 Advantage for the group, which drops down to 2 given their Initiative Bonus. Any additional Advantage gained this Round by any of the Goblins won’t be counted, but now they all benefit from a +20 to all relevant Tests. On the following Round, after gaining +2 more Advantage as a group, one of the Goblins is defeated in an Opposed Melee Test. Normally that Goblin would lose all of their Advantage, but because they are in a group, the group merely loses 2 Advantage, and retains the rest.</p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/good-shot.webp\" /></div><h2>Character Death</h2><p>Campaigns are supposed to be an entire story, from beginning to end, featuring the Characters, right? Well, sometimes that end is a gruesome death… This is the Old World, and death is an old friend, around every corner, always ready to take you into Morr’s Realm.</p><p>But the concept of Character death can be more complex than it first appears. For starters, a death can disrupt an ongoing story, or it can be disappointing to the Player whose Character has just carked it. In this section, we’re going to help you avoid these pitfalls.</p><h3>Survival at a Cost</h3><p>Whilst death should remain a real and present threat to Characters in <strong>WFRP</strong>, it is so unfortunately final. A Character’s death is the end of their story, and as such, is a source of drama only for those who survive. This is fine, but not as effective as the alternative: survival at a cost.</p><p>GMs and Players alike should consider all of the tools available to prevent death whilst steering the story into new and challenging directions. Scars, permanent injuries and amputations, changing and traumatic @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.5w5YLPNd6AaU4f85]{Psychologies}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.115GzWrmkD4viyy5#dark-deals]{Dark Deals} are all examples of evocative, Character-changing, and story-enhancing experiences. A Duellist who loses their primary arm to a stray cannonball and must now find a new way in the world is infinitely more interesting than a Duellist buried in the ground.</p><h3>Embracing Character Death</h3><p>There are a few instances where Character death is the most interesting thing that could happen to them. These moments should come with buy-in from the Player controlling that Character. In this case, a Player should feel empowered, if they so wish, to ignore their Fate Points, and accept that their Character’s story has come to an end. The three most obvious examples are: self-sacrifice, prophetic, and no-way-out deaths.</p><h4>Self-sacrifice Deaths</h4><p>When a Character has the chance to save the life of a friend by sacrificing their own, it is a pivotal moment in a Campaign. This is particularly effective if the bond between the Characters has been given emotional weight throughout the Campaign, as it represents an act that cannot be taken back. However, this is not recommended if the controlling Player still has stories they wish to tell with their Character.</p><h4>Prophetic Deaths</h4><p>Prophecies are everywhere in Warhammer, from the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Doomings} every Imperial child has delivered to them, to those whispered by seers and wizards the Old World over. If a Character is presented with a perfect moment to fulfill a prophecy which would result in them dying, it could be more thematically impactful if the Player accepts this fate. However, prophecies that prove to be wrong right at the last moment can also be sources of dramatic tension, so this can really go either way.</p><h4>No-way-out Deaths</h4><p>Sometimes the situation is so dire that you can’t imagine a way out. Whether your neck is on the chopping block, or a Slaaneshi cultist has a wicked blade to your throat, sometimes it’s better to accept that a Character made some wrong turns along the road of life. Often these sorts of deaths serve to tell a moral — don’t fight the law because the law will win, or don’t get into bed with the servants of She Who Thirsts. However, sometimes those morals need to be flipped on their heads to hammer home the theme — the law is corrupt and deserves to be fought! Don’t use this if you feel backed into a corner, but rather if you feel the death would be satisfying to the story. Even if there seems to be no way out, a spent Fate Point demands unusual and even impossible circumstances arising to save a Character.</p><p>None of these methods work unless a Player wants them to, and ultimately, the decision is in their hands. There is a good reason why Characters have Fate Points to spend!</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>OPTIONS: HEROIC DEATH</em></h3><p><em>Characters who witness a heroic death, such as through self-sacrifice, are changed forever and that memory works to embolden their spirits in times of greater peril. When a Character encounters a situation similar to the heroic death, they gain a +20 bonus to Psychology Tests as they recall the heroic deed.</em></p><p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Daenar, seeing the inevitability of the on-coming Greenskin charge, and the perilous situation her companions are in, decides to hold them back long enough for the rest of her party to cross a rope bridge, cut it loose, and escape. Daenar stands her ground, draws her bow, and shouts at her companions to run. Months later, surrounded by Greenskins once more, Nils, Ezra, and Adelheidi recall the bravery of their fallen comrade, and are encouraged to press on because of it.</p></blockquote><h3>Introducing New Characters</h3><p>When a Character dies, either heroically or hilariously, introducing the Player’s new Character to the existing party can be difficult, especially in the middle of an adventure. Here are a few tactics you can use:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hired help</strong>. The party, recognising they’re missing an important piece, goes looking for someone to fill that niche. It just so happens the right (or perhaps only) person for the job is the new Character.</p></li><li><p><strong>A friend in need</strong>. A beloved NPC is brought forward and becomes a full Character. If you need that Character to fulfill additional roles in the current adventure, either substitute in a different NPC for that role, or tell that Player what functions they need them to serve, and trust them to bring their own little twist.</p></li><li><p><strong>We’re all in this together</strong>. If the Characters find themselves in a perilous situation — imprisoned or enslaved by their enemies, or running through the forest fleeing from whatever killed their friend — it’s easy to put bystanders or other adventuring types in the same situation. Nothing builds unity quite like a shared enemy, after all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reinforcements</strong>. If the Characters have a patron or an organisation who have employed them for their current mission, that employer can send along some needed reinforcements to get the job done.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wait until the next adventure</strong>. Sometimes there’s no good way to jump straight into a new Character. If the next adventure isn’t far off — perhaps the next session — some Players may enjoy the chance to become a co-GM and take control of the Creatures the Characters fight, or to portray some of the cast of NPCs. This kind of change can even be seen as a consolation prize, or reward of sorts for losing a Character.</p></li></ul><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>DOOMINGS WITH 0 FATE</em></h3><p><em>The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Doomed} Talent really takes centre stage when a Character falls to 0 Fate Points, because it’s no longer merely a string of words, but a prophecy which should terrify every Imperial soul. When this happens, you are encouraged to take that Character’s Dooming and attempt to manifest it in the world as much as possible, through both poetic and literal means. Not only does this increase the chances of a Character dying in a manner that matches their Dooming, and therefore increasing thematic cohesion in the story, but it also serves to spotlight that Character, and drive home the dread that is ever present in the Old World.</em></p><p><em><strong>Example</strong>: </em>Nils has the Dooming ‘A kiss shall end thy days,’ and has recently fallen to 0 Fate Points after a nasty encounter with a hook-handed pirate. The GM takes this opportunity to have Marina, a revolutionary that Nils has been spending a lot of time with, grow increasingly emboldened. When the two of them light the fuse on a bomb set to blow up a shrine to the Chaos God Nurgle, Marina — fearing her life is about to be cut short — kisses Nils on the lips. Nils is now terrified even more so than he was already, and has to deal with this new awkwardness… if he doesn’t explode into little gobbets first.</p><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Interpreting a Dooming</em></h3><p><em>Perhaps the greatest thing about a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.fn8QNQQ1S2rh12Us]{Dooming} is how very vague they’re worded despite how very important they are. These simple fragments of ‘wisdom’ are intended to guide a person’s whole life, as they spell out the moment of one’s death! Furthermore, there exists a great taboo in sharing one’s Dooming with another, so what may seem natural to one person would be inexplicably odd to another.</em></p><p><em>Players and Characters should feel free to interpret their Dooming in whatever way they see fit, and should be encouraged to express that interpretation in hilarious ways. For example a Character with the Dooming ‘</em>Trust not the innocence of children, for their plans are far from sound,<em>’ may have an inherent aversion to children, or may feel a strong need to ignore and counteract anything a child says to them. They may take the Dooming literally, and believe that if their plans are ‘far from sound’, then plans involving sounds and noises are inherently trustworthy. Or potentially, if they can’t trust innocent children, maybe they can only trust guilty children, so they encourage the children they know to commit crimes!</em></p><p><em>Remember that the majority of people in the Old World are both superstitious and very very skeptical, which makes for some ridiculous interpretations. Make sure to breathe some truth into their interpretations, but also to exploit other curious (and equally ridiculous) twists of your own.</em></p></blockquote><h2>Between Adventures</h2><p>The rules presented in @UUID[JournalEntry.gLDW6JBuoYuzCoya]{Between Adventures} are one of the great changes in how the game plays in comparison to earlier editions. The rules — whilst entirely optional — present a streamlined and semi-abstracted method of handling everything else the Characters get up to between adventures. Whilst this certainly isn’t the case for every campaign, one of the main themes of Warhammer is that the Characters are normal people and that adventuring is the exception, rather than the rule, of their normal lives.</p><p>If this theme is present in your campaign, and that the Characters are normal people except in the rare occasions that they’re adventuring, the rules for Between Adventures should definitely be a focus for your reading as the GM. Think of the @UUID[JournalEntry.gLDW6JBuoYuzCoya]{Between Adventures} rules as an alternate phase of play — we have the Adventuring Phase and the Between Adventures Phase. When not engaged in one, we’re engaged in the other!</p><p>With this phase mentality, as the GM you may choose to run @UUID[JournalEntry.gLDW6JBuoYuzCoya]{Between Adventures} as a handful of dice rolls, quick decisions, and then move on to the next adventure. Alternately, you may have a ‘break’ session between adventures, where you employ these rules, and allow the Characters to explore their normal lives and pursue their own goals. These downtime sessions act almost more like mini adventures, which grant a lot of agency to your Players to express what they want to do and want to get out of future sessions.</p><h3>A Day in the Life</h3><p>The Between Adventures Phase is the perfect time to consider and adjust a Character’s Career, because it’s the best time to determine <em>if it’s actually their Career at all!</em> Are you actually a Rat Catcher if you never catch rats? Are you actually an Artisan if you don’t follow a trade? If all you do is hunch through sewers and stab mutants, exactly how much of a Scholar are you really?</p><p>Both GMs and Players should be vigilant during this phase, to determine just how much a Character is actually like their Career. But make sure that this isn’t prohibitive: a Merchant doesn’t <em>have to</em> act like a Merchant, but maybe if she’s acting more like a Duellist, a Career change is in order? Use these shifts in attitude to help build a Character’s story, rather than direct it, and you’ll find a far more three-dimensional Character comes of it.</p><h2>Motivations</h2><p>A Character’s @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.GaZa9sU4KjKDswMr#determining-motivation]{Motivation} represents — in a word or short phrase — what they care about most in the world, and what drives them to achieve their @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.Q4C9uANCqPzlRKFD#ambitions]{Ambitions}. In a sense, it’s one of the most important things about a Character, because it tells us why they do what they do! In light of that monumental importance, we’ve compiled a few tools to help GMs and Players alike in choosing and managing their Motivations.</p><h3>Choosing Motivations</h3><p>Choosing Motivations can seem tricky — after all, they’re so important! But it doesn’t have to be a difficult process, especially if you follow these tips, and review the example Motivations presentated below.</p><p>It’s worth stressing that the most interesting Characters are those whose Motivations run contrary to what you would normally expect. Everyone expects a mercenary to care about ‘Wealth’, but what if they actually care about ‘Duty’ to their family, and are sending all their money back home? Everyone expects a Scholar to care about ‘Knowledge’, but what if they are motivated more by ‘Romance’ than anything else? A good rule of thumb when it comes to writing is to throw out your first idea because it’s the obvious one, and the same often applies to a Character’s Motivation.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that your Motivation isn’t locked in stone, it can change whenever you need it to.</p><h3>Changing Motivations</h3><p>A Character’s Motivations are sure to change throughout the course of their adventuring life, and Players and GMs should always be vigilant for when this occurs. Whilst Motivation can be changed at the beginning of every session, it’s a good idea to save these changes for the following moments:</p><ul><li><p>If you find yourself having not played to your Character’s Motivation in a few sessions</p></li><li><p>When you change Career</p></li><li><p>When you complete an Ambition.</p></li></ul><p>Players should use these events to express how their Character has changed, and are encouraged to show off their new Motivation in the coming session. You should award an additional Resolve Point if this change is roleplayed in a believable and dramatic fashion!</p><h3>The 'Check-In'</h3><p>Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, during an intense scene or Combat, it’s difficult to keep track of Motivations, and whether or not they trigger @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.pa22HaRw1OBBQaDg#regaining-resilience-and-resolve]{Resolve}. If you’re finding your group forgets about Motivation often, or if you’d rather not worry about it during a session, try using a Check-In instead.</p><p>A Check-In occurs at the same time as handing out XP, and involves everyone going around the table and announcing their Motivation. Next, everyone considers the session they’ve just played, and decides if that Character expressed their Motivation ‘not at all’, ‘a bit’ or ‘a lot’. Everyone should get a say, and should take this opportunity to point out interesting and humorous moments during the session, but ultimately the Player and the GM together have the final say over how much the Motivation was expressed. This is purely subjective, so go more along how it felt, rather than a point-for-point retelling of the session.</p><p>If a Character expressed their Motivation ‘not at all’, they regain no Resolve. If they expressed it ‘a bit’, they regain 1 Resolve Point, or 2 Resolve for ‘a lot’.</p><h3>Example Motivations</h3><p>The following is a list of example Motivations accompanied by situations which might earn them Resolve.</p><h4>Authority</h4><p>You are motivated by a clear chain of command, and thrive when there are orders to be followed — whether you’re giving them, or taking them. Most people who favour such structure either long for the day when they themselves are able to pass commands down the chain to their lessers, or believe themselves to be merely a cog in a greater machine. Following orders or listening to, and assisting, the authorities garners Resolve.</p><h4>Change</h4><p>You are motivated by a need for change, for a better or brighter future. You are discontent with the status quo, and any action you take that shifts this — whether positively or negatively — is better than what we have now, at least. Anything you do that is counter to the norm feeds into this Motivation.</p><h4>Charity</h4><p>You are motivated by a need to help people. Whilst many give to charity in pursuit of power, status, or out of boredom, you do it for its own sake. Charity, in your eyes, is its own reward. Helping the less fortunate, and giving what you can, regenerates your Resolve.</p><h4>Control</h4><p>You are motivated by a desire to control the world around you. Perhaps you suffer from anxiety, or were raised in a situation where you were the centre of attention — whatever the reason, you thrive when there are no surprises. You regain Resolve when you seek to bend the world around you to your will.</p><h4>Debauchery</h4><p>You are motivated by forbidden delights. Either the fact that they are forbidden is tantilising to you, or you’ve lost sight of healthy appetites long ago, you regain Resolve when you give into your obscene desires.</p><h4>Envy</h4><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/cults/verena.webp\" width=\"213\" height=\"236\" /></div><p>You are motivated by a need to possess that which others have. It could be anything — wealth, romance, land, power — but you desire these things because someone else has them, not for their own merit. When you covet and take from others, you are sure to regenerate Resolve.</p><h4>Faith (God)</h4><p>You are motivated by a deep faith in your patron God of choice, and allow the strictures of such to dictate your life. Choose a God to go along with this Motivation, and regain Resolve whenever you go out of your way to follow that God’s strictures, or protect the honour and sanctity of their worship. A list of Gods and their strictures can be found in @UUID[JournalEntry.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon]{Religion and Belief}.</p><h4>Fame</h4><p>You are motivated by being known. You want your name to be on everyone’s lips, to be well regarded, and to be remembered. When you perform actions in public, or work to spread word of your deeds (real or imaginary), you recover Resolve.</p><h4>Freedom</h4><p>You are motivated by being untethered and allowed to go where you please. Often freed bondsmen, enslaved individuals, or the children of overly oppressive parents burn with this Motivation. You recover Resolve when you choose your own path in the face of authority.</p><h4>Glory</h4><p>You are motivated by a need to achieve great things. You likely have one burning desire — perhaps your Long Term Ambition — which, whenever you work towards it, you recover Resolve.</p><h4>Gluttony</h4><p>You are motivated by an unnatural appetite for something specific, and wish to indulge that vice at all times. When you pursue or partake of your vice, you feed your Motivation and regain Resolve.</p><h4>Hope</h4><p>You are motivated by a hope that things can get better. In the Old World, this is a futile Motivation, but it doesn’t stop thousands of souls trudging towards it every day. When you perform actions that seem doomed to fail, but you do them anyway because you believe it might work out, you regain Resolve.</p><h4>Infamy</h4><p>You are motivated by a desire to be remembered and feared. Like fame, infamy is about developing a personal story that will always be bigger than the person you were, but it differs in that you don’t want to be remembered kindly. You want to forever serve as a lesson to someone or against something, and whenever you strike fear, or encourage rumours about yourself, you regain Resolve.</p><h4>Justice</h4><p>You are motivated by a need to see justice done. Whether it’s a belief that justice holds together society, or a perverse fascination with punishment, you see enacting the law of the Gods — though not necessarily the law of the land — as paramount. Whenever you aid or enact your own justice, regenerate Resolve.</p><h4>Knowledge</h4><p>You are motivated by the search for knowledge itself. You don’t necessarily want to do anything with that knowledge, but the pursuit is what’s important to you. When you learn something new, or encourage the spread of knowledge, you regain Resolve.</p><h4>Love</h4><p>You are motivated by a strong bond of love with someone. Love is often irrational, and causes people to act in ways which deprioritise their own safety or happiness, and doing so is a sure way of earning Resolve.</p><h4>Obligation</h4><p>You are motivated by an obligation you hold — to family, friends, an organisation, and so on. You likely have a role to play in relation to this obligation, and fulfilling that role is of paramount importance to you. Whenever you perform actions that fulfill that role, you regain Resolve.</p><h4>Order</h4><p>You are motivated by structure and order. You thrive when there is a set framework to operate inside of, and rules to follow. You regain Resolve when you follow the rules — especially to your detriment — and help enforce them.</p><h4>Patriotism</h4><p>You are motivated by love of country. This pride can become toxic — used as a pathetic crutch to cover for your own failings — or could stem from true pride in the history of your people — whether deserved or doctored. You recover Resolve by putting your nation first, and by following the dictates of your rulers — rational or otherwise.</p><h4>Perfection</h4><p>You are motivated by a need to be perfect. Regardless of what the focus is, you need to be the perfect example of it, a painter, a poet, a cook, whatever. This Motivation exists beyond any tangible benefits of that perfection or profession, and often strays into a truly unhealthy mindset, for perfection is ultimately impossible. Whenever you work towards that perfection, regain Resolve.</p><h4>Pleasure</h4><p>You are motivated by the pursuit of pleasure, fine food, fine wine, fine friends, and so forth. You seek to get the most out of life, and feel fulfilled when in good, comfortable, pleasurable company. You regain Resolve whenever you take a little extra effort to bring a little extra pleasure into your life.</p><h4>Power</h4><p>You are motivated by a quest for power. It doesn’t matter what power, and over whom, but you feel safer and more whole when the power of any situation is in your hands. This may translate into literal power — the search for arcane potency or martial excellence — but not necessarily. You just have to exert and extend your reach to recover Resolve.</p><h4>Respect</h4><p>You are motivated by the respect of your peers. It’s not necessarily about being the best — the best swordsman, the best incantor, the best alchemist — but you need your peers to heed what you say, and admire your works. You may see yourself as first among equals, or merely rising to the level of your heroes, but either way, when you increase or maintain your standing, you regain Resolve.</p><h4>Revenge</h4><p>You are motivated by a need for revenge. Perhaps someone killed your father and they must prepare to die, or someone ruined your family’s business and now you seek to destroy theirs. Whatever the source of your ire, you seek to reenact it on those who hurt you. Whenever you work towards or fulfill your revenge, recover Resolve.</p><h4>Ruin</h4><p>You are motivated by the ruination of the world around you. You may have a target in mind, a specific nation, family, or organisation, or merely existence itself. Whenever you work to bring your foes to their knees and have them crushed under your boot, you regenerate Resolve.</p><h4>Servitude</h4><p>You are motivated by your service to another. Servitude is a rare Motivation, because it relies on the mind placing the needs of another above one’s own, and trusting in the benevolence of that master. When you act at the behest of those you serve, you recover Resolve.</p><h4>Survival</h4><p>You are motivated first and foremost by your own survival, and will do what you can to protect yourself. This Motivation extends to protecting your livelihood, if it comes under existential threat — a hunter defending their hunting grounds from poachers, or an urchin protecting their streets from invading troops. In any situation where you take an active hand to maintain your survival, you regain Resolve.</p><h4>Unity</h4><p>You are motivated by uniting others towards a common goal. Whether this stems from dreams of Empire, Shallyan pacifism, or a desire to mend an old feud, you regain Resolve when you act to bring others together.</p><h4>Wealth</h4><p>You are motivated by the clink of coins. Whilst almost everyone is motivated in some way by money in the Old World, you desire money for its own sake. You may even be loath to spend it once it is yours. Wealth, for you, doesn’t necessarily mean power or privilege, but it represents a dependable source of strength for yourself. Whenever you seek out wealth and hoard it, regain Resolve.</p><h4>Violence</h4><p>You are motivated by violence, and love the thrill of battle. You might be addicted to the adrenaline, or you’re fascinated by the craft of battle. Whatever the case, whenever you engage in violent acts for their own purpose, regenerate Resolve.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Options: Ruinous Motivations</em></h3><p><em>Some Motivations are, themselves, the pathways of the damned.

A Character’s Status often says more about their world than Class or Career, as it shapes their likely peers, living arrangements, and the logistics of their everyday lives. The following pages are set aside to expand those rules and give advice on how to use them.</p><h3>Costs of Living</h3><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.cwM5veYnAbSjlrvv#the-cost-of-living]{The Cost of Living} states that a Character is expected to spend approximately half their Status and Standing every day to maintain appearances, and that even this exorbitant amount is considered ‘frugal living.’</p><p>Whilst this number seems potentially prohibitive for Brass and Silver Statuses, when it comes to Gold Status, it is outright extortionate! And yet, these numbers reflect a very real situation for transient people, such as Warhammer Characters.</p><p>Firstly, it’s worth remembering that a Character doesn’t begin to lose Standing until they’ve spent a week living beneath their @UUID[JournalEntry.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.R7RQ4hfivLrG0XaF#maintaining-status]{expected expenses}. However, recovering Standing requires this spending every single day for a week to regain one point. It’s easier to maintain a facade than to build one.</p><p>These systems are in place to create an urgency to adventure. The Characters are not typical examples of their Careers, but rather desperate and extraordinary. Their lives exist in a state of constant change that few in the Empire enjoy (or suffer) by virtue of being the focus of our attention at the table. This need to spend money constantly results in a need to earn money — a lot of money — frequently as well, meaning Characters are more likely to take risks, bet on the wrong Middenball team, involve themselves in shady business, and meet dramatic fates. That is one of the central tensions built into the Warhammer world, and one of your greatest tools to exploit when building adventures.</p><h3>Changing Status</h3><p>A Character’s Standing is often in flux, and the folk of the Old World change their Standing often — by the whims of the Gods, the seasons, and through hard work. But changing one’s Status is rather perilous. It is a fundamental threat to the social order of the Empire. The growing middle class directly threatens the existence of the nobility, and in turn the place in the pecking order of favoured peasants. As such, few people look kindly on social climbers, and there is often a host of issues that comes along with increasing or decreasing one’s Status.</p><p>As the GM, it’s your job to reinforce the central conflicts in the Warhammer world, and one of the starkest is the class struggle that underpins everything in the Empire. To reinforce this, consider not just how NPCs not of a Character’s current Status perceive them, but also those of their new and old Statuses after changing Careers. Old friends may now regard the Characters as out of touch or snobby, whilst new peers may see them as uppity or possibly admirable — having ‘<em>pulled themselves up by their bootstraps’</em>. Characters who drop Status may find themselves surrounded by people who consider the Character ‘too <em>big for their britches’</em>, and other such derogatory phrases.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that the Empire, despite how it might seem, is steadfastly not a meritocracy — that is, the best person for the job isn’t always, or even often, the one who fills it. Privilege is everywhere in the Empire, and no one gets to high places alone. Consider who around the Characters may resent them for their rise (small as it may be), or who see them as their own ticket up the social ladder. Use these class struggles as an opportunity for the world to change around the Characters, and in turn for the Character to change their world.</p><h3>Tapping Communities</h3><p>A Character’s peers are often the first place they’ll want to go to find out information about their current Adventures, future opportunities, or just general gossip. As such, it’s a good idea to create a small cast of NPCs in any locale that the Characters will spend their time in who reflect the attitude and temperaments of the three Statuses. These NPCs can act as the mouth-pieces of their communities, as well as key contacts for the Characters as they inhabit those spaces.</p><p>Furthermore, if a locale includes members of certain restricted classes — represented through the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.sYbgpSnRqSZWgwFP]{Etiquette} Talent — they should have their own NPC. Consider how these NPCs may overlap: perhaps a village has three NPCs of each Status, and two Criminal NPCs, one Brass and one Gold. What does this say about the nature of crime in the community? What does this mean for the Characters moving through it?</p><p>Encourage your Players to have their Characters consort primarily with their own communities, and then come together to share that knowledge. Each community will have different things they know about, care about, and can act on. Gold NPCs may be able to manipulate the courts or local State Army, whilst Servant communities likely have more personal noble gossip — because they spend so much time with nobles, who barely notice that they exist.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>OPTIONS: TRANSITIONAL STATUS</em></h3><p><em>Changing Status and Standing in the Old World is more difficult than merely finding a new job.

Unforgettable NPCs help create the impetus to roleplay and cause Players to become invested in what happens to them, and by extension, their own Characters. Not every NPC needs to be a tour de force of personality, but a few ‘shining stars’ go a long way towards filling the firmament with light – or darkness, as the case may be.</p>\n<p>Every NPC you introduce into an adventure should be there for a purpose, which can vary wildly from ‘background scenery’ to ‘biggest bad-guy’ and everything in-between. Some you may place specifically because they can assist the characters or spur them onward by offering something valuable, e.g. knowledge, training, equipment – in exchange for something the Characters can offer them, e.g. investigative skill, money, directed violence. Others serve as potential antagonists or definite enemies, and consider having a few just because they’re fun for you to play and your Players to enjoy.</p>\n<p>The following are the building blocks of an unforgettable NPC. You don’t have to put as much detail into an NPC destined to be a ‘prop’, but that said, remain flexible. With practice, you may find that you create even minor NPCs memorable enough that your Players will occasionally promptly latch onto one, and even though you originally intended them to be nothing more than a bit of background flavour, they’ll soon be dragged into the Characters’ adventures. Fortunately, <strong>WFRP</strong> has a designator for such folks – they make <em>excellent</em> Henchmen.</p>\n<p><strong>A Name</strong> – A decent name will do, but a really good name will stick in the mind. It will likely help you to create a small list of names in advance, checking them off as they get used. That way, if you have to come up with a name ‘on the fly’ when the Characters insist on learning all about the innocuous barkeep, you won’t have to fumble for one. @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.Q4C9uANCqPzlRKFD#name]{Character} has the naming conventions and examples. Keep in mind that other points from later in this list may well be referred to in an NPC’s name, especially if they are rare. There are a lot of forgettable ‘Karls’ in the Empire, but ‘Crimson Karl’ the gent that’s eternally bright beet-red in the face from yelling? He’ll stick out.</p>\n<p><strong>Appearance</strong> – What does the NPC look like? Some folks think they need to put a lot of detail into this, but really, too many details and your Players will just lose track, especially if you have a lot of NPCs. Always note species, but then, try to stick to, at the very most, two or three solid details that stand out.</p>\n<p>Height, weight, eye colour, and so forth, only need to be noted if they are unusual. Scars, odd tattoos, eccentric clothing choices, weird trappings, the fact they always carry a bedraggled cat with a tiny peg leg – these are the things people notice and Players remember.</p>\n<p><strong>Mannerisms</strong> – This is a big category, for it covers style of speech, personality traits, unusual quirks of behaviour, and how the NPC regularly deals with other folk. When determining how an NPC regularly acts, be wary of regularly using stereotypes – not every Dwarf is grumpy and short-tempered, but that said, there is a reason for that stereotype. A general note for an NPCs outward behaviour will often suffice. Are they friendly, taciturn, impatient, hostile?</p>\n<p>Think about what the NPC’s voice sounds like. Especially if their voice sounds nothing like yours, it is okay to tell your Players what the NPCs voice may remind them of. If you want to do a different accent for a specific NPC and feel comfortable doing so, awesome, but be wary of giving strange voices to many NPCs, especially if they hurt your throat to do them. Instead, try playing with your vocabulary, speak in short sentences, using small words for a slow-witted Ogre; speak swiftly, on the edge of breathlessness, for a flighty Halfling.</p>\n<p>A quick search of the internet will yield more lists of example personality traits and quirks of behaviour than you can sic a small but vicious dog on. There are, in fact, whole websites dedicated to such and they can serve as inspiration, but be sure to consider how your Players, and their Characters, will react to certain traits – they are unlikely to want to deal a lot with someone really annoying (which, honestly, might be fun for you if they have to, for a time).</p>\n<p><strong>Career</strong> – What the NPC ostensibly does for a living. Most folk in the Old World are completely tied to their Class and Career and can generally afford to do very little outside of them, unless they are of a higher status with enough wealth to let them ‘indulge’ in different pastimes. Many NPCs may well have had a different Career at one point, but only a few rare ones will have ever jumped between different Classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Unusual Qualities</strong> – This is a catch-all for traits others wouldn’t suspect in the NPC. Particularly high levels of skill, Talents from outside their Career, strange knowledge, @UUID[JournalEntry.3ZynTGhFpgwv6l1n.JournalEntryPage.vUPuF2ZsWvNKUCWy]{Traits} from the @UUID[JournalEntry.3ZynTGhFpgwv6l1n]{Bestiary}, and so on. Most NPCs should only have one or two Unusual Qualities at most, if any. Note that ‘mutations’ generally fall under ‘Problems’.</p>\n<p><strong>Drives</strong> - Whole plots are driven by these most basic questions: What does the NPC want? What are they prepared to do to get it? Like Characters, important NPCs should have ambitions, though not every ambition has to be realistic. A low-born NPC may aspire to be a Baron one day. This is naught but a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.trappings.b6tGqvNe1jYBdeN5]{weirdroot} dream for most folk, but society is changing in the Empire, and a driven merchant, or perhaps a crime lord, with the right connections might just achieve such a lofty goal. Your Characters will certainly have wanted to help such an individual along their way, or perhaps, did everything they could to stop them…</p>\n<p><strong>Problems</strong> – Finally, any NPC you know will interact with the Characters should have a problem or two that the Characters might be able to help them with, or take advantage of, which may, or may not, tie into their ambitions. Try to think of problems with multiple potential solutions, e.g. an NPC that has something the Characters desperately want, desires to advance in their Trade Guild, but feels trapped and doesn’t know how to. Depending on the Characters’ skill sets, they could spread gossip about the superior nature of the NPC’s wares, sabotage or kill their competition, bribe their superiors, etc. Some problems should actually be ‘secrets’ which may, or may not, have an actual solution, e.g. hidden mutations, holding to a forbidden faith, an unrequited love, etc. Most such problems can’t be ‘solved’, but they’re ripe for blackmail.</p>\n<h2>Sample NPCs</h2>\n<div style=\"display:flex;justify-content:space-evenly;flex-wrap:wrap\">\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/gm/dieter.webp\" width=\"213\" height=\"180\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.ePPk15Vxu9RxPtYV]{Dieter Käsegeier, Cheesemonger Extraordinaire}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/gm/kastor.webp\" width=\"197\" height=\"186\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.Rs3lMA5UavTlTiJW]{Kastor Erichson, Jumpy Hunter}</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display:flex;flex-direction:column;justify-content:space-evenly;align-items:center\"><img style=\"border:none\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/gm/stellemar.webp\" width=\"216\" height=\"213\" />\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.bestiary.nRJxtciIhTHKqAvY]{Stellemar, Loyal Hound}</p>\n</div>\n</div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"name":"Appendix","type":"text","_id":"7a0PxhI1WMGxGsAL","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">I Need A Job</h3><p>If your Characters find themselves out of a job or looking for work, and you haven’t planned an adventure, roll 3d100 on the following table to quickly come up with a hook for Who, What, and Why an adventure might happen.</p><p>@Table[job]</p><h3 style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">How Do I Know You Again?</h3><p>Sometimes your Characters have a fully formed backstory in mind.

It is perhaps the most direct piece of iconography used by any college, for Azyr’s power floats among the stars. Celestial lore is rooted in the movements of heavenly bodies and the influence they exert upon the world. The narrow tail and broadening head of the comet mirrors the ever-expanding knowledge of the Celestial College. Furthermore, the comet is usually depicted with its head reaching skyward, symbolising transcendent ambition. Only on robes of mourning, worn in reverence to departed fellows, is the symbol inverted, in this case commemorating a great wizard fallen in death. Alongside the comet, Celestial Wizards employ such heavenly signs as stars and crescent moons.</p><p>The buildings of the Celestial College lie near the centre of Altdorf ’s Hexxerbezrik. Concealment spells cloak the grounds, guarding passersby from their dangerous curiosities. The elegant towers of the Celestial College are the tallest of all buildings in the city. There are sixteen towers, four times four, with four being the number of Azyr in the lore of sorcery. Each one is topped by a glass dome from which the astromancers observe the sky at night.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>The Heavenly Wind</em></h3><p><em>Azyr is a light and insubstantial wind that quickly dissipates into the upper portion of the heavens, forming a backdrop of drifting blue clouds.

Those who stay in the college may be involved in the Grand Experiment or spend their time politicking for a study higher in the towers. Other astromancers are wanderers, exploring the world for new perspectives on the heavens or rumours of portents in distant lands. Some sell their talents to sea captains in exchange for passage to foreign parts. Astromancers are valued advisors to the powerful and some establish themselves in a noble’s retinue.</p><p>The first astromancers were stargazers, astrologers, and those who unconsciously manipulated the Blue Wind. Teclis helped them channel their abilities into the Lore of Heavens, a body of sorcery later expanded by human magisters to encompass spells to harness the airy element, discern fate, and change it to their will.</p><p>Divination amongst astromancers is a combination of magical prowess, mathematics, and close interpretation of portents. Every member of the Celestial Order scrutinises the heavens for a glimpse of the future, but some also use other means. Crystal balls are said to focus Azyr and make it easier to read. Astromancers often use the movement of air itself, by interpreting the patterns of wind on water, the swaying of trees or the drift of fine ashes when thrown into the air.</p><p>The typical astromancer is an intellectual with their head almost literally in the clouds. They use their impressive powers of reason to untangle the unknowable, which keeps them divorced from trivial day-to-day matters. They live for study, writing treatises on magical theory, astronomy, meteorology, and prognostication.</p><p>Celestial Wizards tend to arrogance and petty academic spats proliferate. Prognostication is lucrative and many astromancers are wealthy, spending their riches on fine, ostentatious robes and elaborate astronomical and magical instruments.</p><h3>Relationships</h3><h4>The Imperial Navy</h4><p>The Imperial Sea Lords have long cultivated an association with astromancers, who are much in demand for their ability to read the night sky, control the weather, and foresee perils at sea. The Celestial College have leveraged this to fuel their appetite for exploration. Astromancers join ship’s companies in exchange for the Navy furnishing expeditions.</p><p>Lord Xavier Köhler is a Celestial Wizard who holds high naval rank, known as the Transcriber of Wind for his preternatural ability to foresee and change the weather. He fought with Karl-Franz at the Battle of Nordland Fjord and now advises his older brother, Imperial Sea Lord Baron Ludolf Köhler of Dietershafen.</p><h4>The Cult of Verena</h4><p>Astromancers are scholars who value the acquisition of knowledge, so they have a natural affinity with the Cult of Verena. More than one Celestial magister has granted benefactions or bequeathed his library to a temple and the relationship is mostly harmonious. Some priests detect a faint condescension from the astromancers, tainted by a suspicion that wizards lack reverence for the divine. The influential Verenan abbot Gregor Zweifler writes letters to high priests across the Empire, warning that the astromancers have taken to worshipping planets over gods and that the cult must take action.</p><h4>The Cult of Morr</h4><p>The Cult of Morr is split on the matter of astromancy. The God of Dreams is not a jealous deity and his augurs in the Empire occasionally consult with the college for an expert second opinion when they receive troubling portents. However, hard-line Morrians outside the Empire preach that unless precognition comes from Morr, it is inspired by the Great Conspirator. Recently the unveiling of the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.LCEiXpNXK9clKNyh]{Thaumodivinator}, a fortune telling machine designed by wizards of the Celestial Order, has led to increased tensions with the Cult of Morr.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Celestial Wind","type":"text","_id":"N8s4rKsTaQ8rRUU3","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Drifting high in the atmosphere, <em>Azyr</em> represents that which is out of reach. As it streams from the Aethyr, the wind curls and swirls in complex patterns across the heavens. It is distant and diffuse, elusive to those who wish to manipulate it to their own ends.</p><p>To understand <em>Azyr</em>, one must labour at complex calculations and ultimately accept that even the wisest mage is subject to the whims of fate. <em>Azyr</em> passes backwards and forwards in time and can bring visions of the future to the present.</p><p>Gusts of <em>Azyr</em> influence the mundane world, whipping the air into squalls and changing the weather. During a storm, <em>Azyr</em> accumulates and sculpts the storm clouds and tempests, growing in strength with the gales and rain. With the right incantation, it can rush beyond the atmosphere to pluck meteorites or comets from the unfathomable beyond.</p><p>Astromancers spend much of their time observing celestial bodies, trying to fathom their motion to master the wind of <em>Azyr</em>. They know that when planets and stars align in specific configurations or describe certain orbits across the sky, <em>Azyr</em> becomes more pliable and reveals its secrets more readily.</p><p>The Blue Wind is placed on the Wheel of Magic in opposition to Ghur, which is earthy, terrestrial, and primal. High-minded, unfathomable <em>Azyr</em> rarely touches the ground. Only in elevated places, such as atop a mountain, can a magister experience the wind flowing around them.</p><p>When a wizard channels <em>Azyr</em> to cast a spell, their incantations take the form of complex formulae spoken in the language of Magick. The words reflect and anticipate the motions of the wind and stars. While the complexity of <em>Hysh</em> demands discipline and patience, <em>Azyr</em> challenges the intellect, requiring precision and the quick mind of the magister. Should they succeed, the Lore of Heavens grants dominion over the element of air, but most astromancers crave the power of foresight and portents, whether to change fate or bring it about.</p><h3>The Celestial College</h3><p>High above Altdorf, the sixteen slender towers of the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.msCj2r9nBQyj7D8g]{Celestial College} soar into the sky, as if the magisters are trying to reach the stars themselves. Each is surmounted by a glass dome, from which the most exalted astromancers gaze upwards into the night sky. Despite its spectacular presence, few citizens of the Imperial capital ever acknowledge the blue and white stone college. It is protected by enchantments to divert attention and bring innocuous distractions which subtly draw the eye away. Perhaps a flag blows into their line of sight, or a line of laundry billows to block their view. Those determined to reach the college gates will do so, but casual onlookers have no clear memories of its presence.</p><p>Until 102 years ago, the college was an impressive but mundane five-storey building in the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.LqyTrO7VNeMDukKY]{Hexxerbezrik} district, reputedly built on Elven ruins. When Helmut Rozenkranz became High Celestial, he constructed the first glass-domed tower. This sparked the so-called Time of the Towers when Wizard Lords vied to build ever-taller observatories. When the Celestarium was completed, taller than the rest, the Emperor decreed an end to the astromancer’s rivalry. This tower is a spectacular sight, with its enchanted glass and great orrery mounted at the summit. Other towers are named for former inhabitants, such as the Tower of Casandora, Urannon’s Observatory, and Gabriel’s Chamber with its impressive moondial.</p><p>The outside walls are inscribed with comets, stars, planets, and moons. Beyond the main doors, the air is fresh and wall hangings and tapestries move in a gentle breeze with no obvious source. Near the entrance is a suite of receiving rooms where Astromancers host visitors, including those willing to pay handsomely for auguries.</p><p>There are living quarters for the acolytes and college servants, several libraries, and the private chambers of resident astromancers. At the core of the college building is the Grand Experiment — where portents are entered into a large silver astrolabe. The astromancers believe this will eventually predict the entire future with complete accuracy.</p><p>Astromancers are notoriously bad at the mundane tasks in life, so the Celestial College has many servants. There are skilled artisans such as lensmakers, horologists, and other artificers, who create new devices for studying the heavens. Countless housekeeping staff keep magisters fed and the halls clean.</p><p>A specialist crew of cartwrights keep the Hurricanums battle-ready at all times.</p><p>The current High Celestial is Hildegard Niederthaler, a sprightly 87-year-old who monopolises three towers in the college for her personal use, including the Celestarium. The portents imply her time in office is coming to an end and other wizard lords are manoeuvring to take her place. Lord Stern Glazend is a likely successor.</p><p>He believes the college should encourage exploration, after learning that the ancient and mysterious denizens of Lustria supposedly left gold plaques which describe every event from past to future. One of Glazend’s allies is Bartolomi Kereveld, who plans an expedition to find lost knowledge of the cosmos in Lustria’s jungle ruins.</p><p>A rival faction favour Lord Methuselis, who has seen ominous (albeit contradictory) portents of the End Times. He wants the Celestial Order to focus on predicting and countering the threat of the Ruinous Powers. His supporters extend their influence with the Empire’s rulers and some take direct action against agents of Chaos.</p><p>Outside Altdorf, the Celestial College has many holdings, typically observatories dedicated to tracking the flow of <em>Azyr</em>. The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua1.journals.Fr9C6ybzrjBUTcyr]{Tower of Vane}, for example, stands high in the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.w0YfGxsBuLoODCgc]{Grey Mountains} above Ubersreik, overseen by @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-ua1.actors.UcCdrNkDrjGUXbj5]{Sibylle Hagerdorn}, who is grateful for the distance between herself and her former rival the High Celestial.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\"><em>Celestial Hurricanum</em></h3><p><em>The Hurricanum is a bizarre engine of war built originally for mobile astronomical observation.

He supports Lord Glazend, but would rather the two factions looked outwards to the threats to the Empire’s magisters — the witch hunters, the forces of Chaos, and the whims of the nobility. When he expresses these opinions, other astromancers claim that he’s getting ahead of himself and that he’ll get to the top of the college when it’s foreseen and not before.

What they took on faith, I saw as a logical process, a sequence of steps that would lead to a predictable outcome. No god required! But, more than that, I saw Chamon, the Gold Wind. I saw it blow from the Great Rift in the north, seeding the world with metals. Not just gold, but iron and lead and all of them. I saw how those metals were suffused with Chamon’s magic and how I, with the right words and enough will, could do things Haendryk never taught us.</em></p><p><em>I was ashamed of my heresy.

The symbol of the Second Lore is the soaring eagle, and its wizards wear robes of glinting yellow.</p><p>The Second Lore concerns metals and alchemical change. Gold Wizards often bear the traces of their research. Their robes may be stained or sooty and their hair singed or marked with chemical spills.</p><p>The Golden Order are the most accomplished alchemists in the Old World. They practise the transmutation of metals as well as spells of forging and runic inscription. Though much of their magic is of this nature, Gold Wizards can conjure molten metals to scorch and consume. They also cast spells to corrode and weaken iron in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The buildings of the Golden Order are like a great forge with many tall stacks that belch multi-coloured glowing smoke into the air. The College lies by the River Reik, whose waters cool the forges and periodically run with fantastical colours following experiments, or accidents. Unlike many of the Colleges of Magic, the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.Fb3OQZlEGiDufND9]{Golden College’s} campus is clearly visible to those without magical sight, but few outside the faculty, students, and visiting alumni go near it, owing to the evil smells and thick smoke which surround it.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Magical Magnetism</em></h3><p><em>The Wind of Chamon is heavy and dense. It is attracted to metal as metal itself is attracted to a magnet, and is most attracted to gold. It is said that this alone accounts for the almost sorcerous effect that gold exerts upon many, inciting greed, violence, and war.</em></p><p><em>In the Old World, Gold Wizards have access to </em>Chamon <em>in most circumstances. As a heavy wind it does tend to settle close to the poles, so Characters who travel towards the equator suffer from –1 SL to Channelling (Chamon) Tests.</em></p><p><em>In places where great quantities of metal are found, such as mines in ore-rich areas, treasure vaults, Dwarf steamships, and so on, Characters may benefit from +1 SL to Channelling (Chamon) Tests.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Semiotics of the Golden Order</h3><p>The Gold College chose a soaring eagle as the symbol of <em>Chamon</em>. It is an odd choice in many ways, for whilst eagles soar high above the world, the Gold Wind is heavy and dense, quickly sinking into the ground. Yet the eagle was ever a symbol of power and nobility to the Elves of Ulthuan, from whom the Golden Order learned to channel <em>Chamon</em>. It is this tradition that the Gold College claims to honour.</p><p>For outsiders — who are often less than inclined to be charitable toward the Gold College — the soaring eagle is considered more an indication of the wizards’ aloofness, and their assumed superiority over others. In truth, many alchemists are egotistical in the extreme and their actions do little to dispel such beliefs.</p><p>There is speculation that Gold Wizards indulge in intellectual vanity by way of compensation for their marred physique. Constant tinkering with acids and molten metals has left many an alchemist heavily scarred, burned, and mutilated, leaving only their minds with any claim to perfection.</p><h3>The Craft of Chamon</h3><p>In their laboratories and workshops, and in cooperation with the Imperial Gunnery School, Gold Wizards test formulae for more powerful and stable blackpowder for the Empire’s armies. They seek the secrets of True Steel, an alloy both lighter and more resistant than common steel. They craft items both useful and beautiful, potions to bring temporary magical aid and wondrous devices, such as mechanical guard dogs of gold and silver — for those who can meet their price.</p><p>Magister-alchemists are no mere artisans, however, no matter how their more esoteric brethren might sniff at them. The higher one climbs in the Golden Order, the more time a magister devotes to the inner mysteries of <em>Chamon</em> — essence, transformation, and purification. This is the study of what the magisters call ‘High Alchemy’, seeking to extract the most concentrated physical form of a wind from a substance to fuel their magic, with <em>Chamon</em> as the catalyst. As the senior magisters describe it to their apprentices, they want to understand the true nature of metal and its potentials, thus allowing them to change it from one state to another — cold to hot, for example, or new to corroded.</p><p>The Gold Wizards have long wrestled with problems their arts tell them must have solutions, such as the curse of mutation. If Chaos can warp and change a person in infinite ways by twisting and polluting their nature, then surely <em>Chamon</em> has the power to reverse this by purifying that nature. Thus, in the laboratories and forges of the Gold College, senior wizards search unceasingly for a ‘spiritual @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.FjWKFpzy3UOI3hlW]{Al-kahest},’ described as a mystic acid that burns away the taint of Chaos, while cleansing the person. Though all the trials so far have met with failure, the occasionally catastrophic work goes on.</p><p>While centred in its college in Altdorf under the guidance of Patriarch @UUID[JournalEntry.kLTWtoz5d7Yt2zAJ.JournalEntryPage.FtKYmBEuLSrtLtRG]{Balthasar Gelt}, Gold Wizards are found throughout the Empire, often as advisors to powerful nobles. Its research generates a strong demand for raw materials, particularly precious metals, and so the order has ownership stakes and even outright control of many mines, where there is often a mid-level magister in residence. This need to deal with the world beyond the college — to negotiate for resources, oversee vital interests, and deal with non-magisters on a day to day basis — has made the Gold Wizards seem the most approachable in the public eye and more accepted than members of other orders.</p><p>The Gold College keeps a close eye on more mundane alchemists and tinkerers, too, both to make sure they do not engage in forbidden research and to find the most promising candidates for induction. Thus, apprentice magisters of the Gold College tend to already be accomplished practical alchemists, at least with non-magical applications.</p><h3>Relationships</h3><p>Of all the colleges, the Alchemists have perhaps the best relations with society at large. Many Gold Magisters live in Altdorf ’s nicer neighbourhoods, often interacting with ‘normal’ Altdorfers.</p><h4>Nobility</h4><p>Gold Magisters are particularly close to the wealthy and powerful, who are sources of patronage and can easily afford to buy the products of their research. Members of the order frequently visit the Imperial Court and the workshops of the State Army. Avaricious nobles like to sponsor an apprentice to the Golden Order who they hope to make a member of their court once they are granted a licence.</p><h4>Dwarfs</h4><p>Relations with the Dwarfs are strained. Although they cooperate on projects of mutual interest, a faction within the order believes the Dwarfs have a natural affinity for <em>Chamon</em> and are hiding their secrets. On the other hand, many Dwarfs think the order just wants their gold.</p><h4>Revolutionaries</h4><p>There is nothing but hostility between the order and Altdorf ’s radicals. The demagogues of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.rSRadYoaNXkEq8gs.JournalEntryPage.F6TqV2NzkEUQYOcg#plant]{PLANT} denounce the Magisters as class enemies who only serve to prop up the oppressive regime. The Order, in return, calls the radicals ‘<em>dupes of the Ruinous Powers’</em>. PLANT’s words may be having an effect — a recent explosion destroyed a magister’s workshop and has been rumoured to be something more than a mere lab accident.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"The Gold Wind","type":"text","_id":"RmCQLDxu6VgCFRdI","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>A popular song in Nuln, <em>The Golden Touch</em>, claims that Gold Wizards can pluck ‘<em>Crowns from the sky, drifting like leaves on a breeze only they can see’</em>. While the alchemists do not literally see gold coins in the air, this popular misconception does touch on two truths: that magisters of the Gold College do perceive Chamon as it flows through the world, and that they have an affinity for metals of all kind due to their interaction with the Golden Wind.</p><p>But what do they see?</p><p>Magisters, as well as witches and others with the Sight, perceive <em>Chamon</em> in varying ways. For some, it washes the world with colour. The air has a yellowish tinge as the wind flows through it, heavier toward the ground, as if drawn to the earth. <em>Chamon</em> leaves behind a patina only those with the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} Talent can see. For others, <em>Chamon</em> resembles motes of gold dust, falling like snow in places where it is strong, covering things sensitive to it like frosting on a cake. Regardless, its intensity indicates the item’s usefulness for alchemical work, as well as the potential presence of a large source of ore.</p><p>This includes the magisters themselves, who to their colleagues can seem dusted with gold, giving them an almost metallic look. In the case of the strongest Gold Wizards, the lesser members of the college sometimes see them as living statues of gold, transformed by the <em>Chamon</em> they have absorbed.</p><p>It is this transforming power that gives <em>Chamon</em> its association with alchemy, both mundane and mystical, and explains the emphasis Gold Magisters place on alchemical and metallurgical research. Beyond its popular association with gold and opulence, <em>Chamon</em> is about transformation and purification. It is about changing the state of a thing to meet a current need, such as making a sword too hot to hold.</p><p>It seeks to remove impurities from a substance until only its essence remains, leaving the most potent example of the substance possible — True Gold, for example, the purest form of the purest metal, which some suspect may be the key to a cure for mutation. And it is why the wealthy and the noble covet potions created by the college’s magisters, as it is their understanding of <em>Chamon</em> that makes them so potent.</p><h3>The Gold College</h3><p>Located in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.LqyTrO7VNeMDukKY]{Hexxerbezrik} neighbourhood, ‘The Foundry,’ as Altdorfers commonly call the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.Fb3OQZlEGiDufND9]{Gold College}, is the headquarters of the order. Five stories tall at its highest — the Tower of Cas Meijer, which only the most senior Magisters and the Patriarch himself may enter — it looks less like a centre of learning than it does some weird, forbidding workhouse. A jumble of buildings, galleries, towers, smokestacks, and workshops, the college presents a severe, almost grimy face to the world. The area is often treated to foul odours coming from it, and coloured smokes sometimes belches from the chimneys (or the windows, if something has gone wrong). There are flashes of light and sometimes the sharp report of explosions.</p><p>Beneath the college there are secure, lead-lined laboratories, where magisters and their apprentices conduct the riskiest research. Water pumped from @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.Zhp59VXYiv6dGfhR]{the Reik} cools the great forges of these chambers, only to gush back from outlets into the river in a myriad of colours that stain the Reik for miles downstream. The college claims these effluents are safe, but only the poorest or most foolhardy swim in it or eat fish caught here.</p><p>The inside reveals an opulence that would humble any wealthy guildmaster and most nobles. Entering through the main doors past the iron statue of an alchemist peering at the contents of a flask — said by locals to be a past magister who had an unfortunate lab accident — visitors behold floors of marble laced with gold, walls of fine hardwoods decorated with gold and silver ornamentation, and hangings of cloth of gold. Stained glass windows in various shades of yellow give the hallways a golden cast. Statues of famous past magisters stand in marble niches, and there is even a place of honour for a statue of Handrich, indicating the good relations between the Golden Order and the cult.</p><p>Off the hallways are lecture halls, seminar rooms, comfortable dormitories for the apprentices, and the private chambers of the magisters, with their own laboratories. The most senior, including @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.9u5V79gIzWHDLWqH]{Patriarch Gelt}, reside on the fourth floor, overlooking @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.ozE2DMCMK64eE5pD.JournalEntryPage.Zhp59VXYiv6dGfhR]{the Reik}. At the centre of the complex is the Library of Chamon, home to thousands of books, scrolls, and documents on alchemy, mundane chemistry, metallurgy, and the lore of the Gold Wind. It is open only to members of the order and is always supervised by a Magister Librarian and his apprentices.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/spot-magic-scroll.webp\" width=\"289\" height=\"88\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Balthasar Gelt","type":"text","_id":"FtKYmBEuLSrtLtRG","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/actors/balthazar-gelt.webp\" width=\"253\" height=\"336\" /></div><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.9u5V79gIzWHDLWqH]{Balthasar Gelt}</p><p>Fascinated with alchemy, as a young man, Gelt left home and travelled the southern Old World, studying with master alchemists in Araby, Tilea, and Estalia. In each, the student inevitably became the teacher as he absorbed and expanded on their wisdom, with his tutors inevitably acknowledging him as their master. Eventually, he came to the Empire by way of Marienburg where, in Altdorf, the senior magisters admitted him without serving an apprenticeship.</p><p>But this story is a fiction — or, at best, speculation.</p><p>What is known is that @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.9u5V79gIzWHDLWqH]{Gelt} arrived in Marienburg fifteen years ago aboard a Tilean merchant ship, making a hasty exit from the city when the gold he used to pay for his passage turned to lead a few days later. Though he speaks Reikspiel with the diction and vocabulary of the nobility, his accent betrays hints of something more exotic, though none have been able to place it. As for his prior life, discreet investigations in southern lands have learned little. Those known to have dealt with Balthasar Gelt — almost assuredly not his real name, though no earlier is known — refuse to speak of him.</p><p>It is true that the senior magisters and then-matriarch, Magdalena Althaus, granted him status as a licenced magister without passing the usual tests — no one before or since has shown such skill with a single Wind of Magic without formal training, yet @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.9u5V79gIzWHDLWqH]{Gelt} demonstrated an undisputable mastery of <em>Chamon</em>. His zeal made him effective both in the workshop and the lecture hall, where he was quite popular with the apprentices. Eventually his skill carried him past several more senior magisters to become the youngest Patriarch of the Gold Order since its founder, Cas Meijer.</p><h3>A Mask all of Gold</h3><p>Then came what is simply referred to as ‘the accident’. @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.9u5V79gIzWHDLWqH]{Gelt} had locked himself in his lab, refusing entry even to his apprentices, claiming that his experiment was ‘Something I alone must do’. It was thought at the time that he was working on creating the long-sought spiritual @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.FjWKFpzy3UOI3hlW]{Al-kahest}. Regardless, something went horribly wrong. One night, an explosion rocked the college buildings. Passersby saw glowing light ‘brighter than the sun’ and yellow smoke billowing from the windows of Gelt’s laboratory.</p><p>Then came the scream, a cry of agony and horror that tore through the night. When his colleagues tried to break down the door to help their Patriarch, they were stopped by a shouted command from within that brooked no dissent, ‘Leave us!’</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.9u5V79gIzWHDLWqH]{Gelt} emerged a day later, seemingly unscathed, but clothed head to toe in golden robes, gloves, and cowl, and wearing a gold mask, which none has seen him remove since. Only his eyes were visible: clearly his, but cold and disturbing, leading to speculation that he had suffered some sort of horrible miscast that scarred or mutated him physically, or even suffered the touch of Tzeentch.</p><p>His personality changed, too. Still a zealous researcher, perhaps even more so, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.9u5V79gIzWHDLWqH]{Gelt} was no longer the engaging colleague or inspiring teacher of before. Now he was coldly logical, devoid of emotion. His presence left others wondering if he saw them as just more subjects for experimentation. Even some of his fellow patriarchs found his gaze disquieting.</p><p>Still, @UUID[JournalEntry.kLTWtoz5d7Yt2zAJ.JournalEntryPage.FtKYmBEuLSrtLtRG]{Balthasar Gelt} is an invaluable adviser to the Emperor, and is frequently at Court.

However, outside adventuring, most lives centre on a single coin type as determined by @UUID[JournalEntry.wczCPcuHT4VQDLpL.JournalEntryPage.R7RQ4hfivLrG0XaF]{Social Status}. </p><p>Those seeking to maintain their Status must also keep up appearances. After all, if you repeatedly appear as poorer than you are, others will unsurprisingly think you’re poor. In practice, dressing and eating as expected, and using trappings that are fitting for your station, is enough for most folks to simply accept you at face value. What this requires in practice is left up to the GM to determine, using the following as a guide:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Brass Tier</strong>: The poorest members of society are unlikely to see a gold coin in their lifetimes. They live humble lives, subsisting on plain foods and sleeping in shared rooms, and have little appearances to maintain. Indeed, peers are more likely to call them out for having airs and graces for spending too much on fine clothes and food than they are likely to note spending too little.</p></li><li><p><strong>Silver Tier</strong>: The swelling middle-classes may use pennies for ale and gold for major purchases, but shillings are their standard currency. They dine well, sleep in comfortable beds, and wear good quality clothing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gold Tier</strong>: The wealthiest elites rarely bother themselves with pfennigs. They eat luxury foods, sleep on satin sheets, and always stand out from the crowd due to their expensive garb and trappings.</p></li></ul><p>For GMs preferring hard numbers, spending around half your Status every day is usually enough to maintain appearances, though you may be living a little frugally. So, if you have a Status of Silver 4, spending at least 2 shillings per day will do for food and board, where if you have Brass 2 Status, you need only spend a pfennig a day.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Money Slang</em></h3><p><em>Various slang terms are used for coins across the Empire.

That number may initially look arbitrary, but if you translate it to pennies, it becomes a far more understandable 80d, or one third of a gold crown. Indeed, an 80d coin is fairly common in the Empire, and is called a noble.</em></p><p><em>Don’t worry too much about fully understanding the coins to begin with. An easy way to keep everything right in your head is to translate all prices to pennies and think of it in your local currency to get a grip of the numbers. So, if British, you could think of a brass penny as £1, a silver coin as worth around £12, and a crown as £240. It’s not accurate, but does help keep the money understandable until you are used to it. So, if someone offered you a job for 10 shillings, think of it as £120, which is a fair bit of money.

For the Rogues in your party, two schemes concerning coins are worth knowing.</p><h4>Counterfeiting</h4><p>The diversity of coinage circulating the Empire means counterfeiting is rife. Reiklanders may be accustomed to seeing coins from other provinces, but are always wary of being scammed. A successful <strong>Evaluate</strong> Test will detect counterfeit coins, typically by inspecting coins for weight and hardness.</p><p>Actually producing counterfeit coins is much harder. It requires an <strong>Art (Engraving)</strong> Test to carve a convincing stamping die, then a <strong>Trade (Blacksmith)</strong> Test to strike the coins, usually with the aid of an assistant. Including a higher precious metal content makes Evaluate Tests to detect counterfeits more difficult; using less than a fifth makes it much easier to spot the fake coins.</p><h4>Clipping</h4><p>Embezzlers can trim slivers of precious metal away from the edges of coins. This scam is called ‘clipping’ or ‘shaving’ and is practised mainly by shopkeepers or tollkeepers who have access to large quantities of other peoples’ money. Gold and silver filings are then melted down and sold to jewellers, counterfeiters, or fences. Clipped coins can be detected with the Evaluate Skill; the more of the coin that’s clipped, the easier the Test. </p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>The Nuln Standard</em></h3><p><em>Altdorf may be the current capital of Reikland and the Empire, but coinage standards are established in the city-state of Nuln to the south.

As a general rule-of-thumb, villages have a single item in stock, towns have [[/r 1d10 # Number of items]] items, and cities have as many as the GM deems appropriate. These quantities are generally doubled for Common items, and halved for Rare ones (rounding up).</p><h3>Bargaining and Trading</h3><p>People of the Empire love a good bargain, and crowds of eager shoppers fill town squares every day looking for the best deals. When buying goods, there are two primary Skills to Test: Evaluate and Haggle.</p><p>Evaluate is used by consumers to identify the quality of an item. Similarly, the vendor can use Evaluate to appraise coins for their exchange value, or spot counterfeits. Anyone can also use Evaluate to estimate the prices of Rare or Exotic items to within +/-10%.</p><p>Haggle is used routinely by consumers and vendors alike, typically with Opposed Tests. Haggling is expected and most prices are marked up slightly to account for this. Winning a Haggle Test reduces the price by 10% (or possibly up to 20% with an Astounding Success (6+) or with the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.epPBu7x6BRWp2PHG]{Dealmaker} Talent). Failing a Haggle contest badly usually means the vendor distrusts your coinage.</p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>Upon posting an Item to chat, you can click the haggle arrows modify the items price by +/-10%</p></blockquote><h4>Roleplaying Shopping Trips</h4><p>Trips to the market for routine purchases don’t need to be roleplayed in detail. The GM might prefer you browse the equipment lists and check for Availability yourself. Major purchases that involve item Craftsmanship, or require extra Haggling, can be fun to roleplay in-character. In certain scenarios, shopkeepers are important NPCs with distinct personalities or story roles, so it’s always worth interacting with them. Consider the following when roleplaying shopping:</p><ul><li><p>The GM may overrule Availability as dictated by local details. For example, basic rowboats are automatically available if the adventure is located in a fishing village that features a renowned boat-builder.</p></li><li><p>Availability percentages can be increased by +10% or +20%if a character is especially diligent, belongs to a relevant career such as Merchant or Fence, or spends an entire day shopping and making Gossip Tests.</p></li></ul><h3>Selling</h3><p>Selling your trappings during desperate times, or simply offloading loot, is handled in exactly the same fashion as Buying, but this time you’ll be making money, not spending it. So, you first check for Availability of a buyer in the same fashion as checking for stock. You then bargain and trade, with Evaluate Tests and Haggle Tests as the GM prefers, and finally you set a price. Typically, the base cost when selling is half the item’s listed price, meaning, when selling second-hand, you usually make between a quarter to half an item’s worth after Haggling.</p><p>If you have a Career like fence or merchant, and you put time into Gossip Tests and wandering the local town, you might find someone willing to pay up to 80% of the item’s listed value, though that is left in the hands of the GM.</p><h4>Lowering the Price</h4><p>If you can’t find a buyer, you can try lowering the price. Each time you half the money you are willing to accept, the Availability of a buyer increases by one step.</p><p><strong>Example</strong><em>: Corporal Mauser has fled his State Army regiment with a Hochland Longrifle he stole, and is keen to sell. As it’s an Exotic item, there are no immediate buyers he can find on the street. The GM determines the base price Mauser can expect is half the weapon’s value (so 50GC, half of the 100GC it’s worth), so Mauser decides to drop the price by half two times, saying he will accept 12GC 10/–, which increases the Availability of a Buyer two steps from Exotic to Scarce.</em></p><h3>Bartering</h3><p>Rural and mercantile commerce often involves trading one commodity for another without exchanging money. To resolve bartering of this type, compare the Availability of the items being traded against those being acquired. The barter ratio indicates how many ‘units’ must be traded, and how many ‘units’ of the other commodity are acquired. ‘Units’ are defined by checking the equipment list prices of both items and grouping them into packages of roughly equivalent value.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Bartering Ratios</span></h3><table style=\"width:460px;height:102px;text-align:center\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong> </strong></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\" colspan=\"4\"><em><strong>Acquired Items</strong></em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em><strong>Traded Items</strong></em></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Common</em></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Scare</em></td><td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Rare</em></td><td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Exotic</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em><strong>Common</strong></em></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>1:1</em></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>2:1</em></td><td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>4:1</em></td><td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>8:1</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em><strong>Scarce</strong></em></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>1:2</em></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>1:1</em></td><td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>2:1</em></td><td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>4:1</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em><strong>Rare</strong></em></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>1:4</em></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>1:2</em></td><td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>1:1</em></td><td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>2:1</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"width:99px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em><strong>Exotic</strong></em></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>1:8</em></td><td style=\"width:89px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>1:4</em></td><td style=\"width:79px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>1:2</em></td><td style=\"width:88px;text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>1:1</em></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"name":"Craftsmanship","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The items available in the shops, stalls, and merchant halls of the Empire vary significantly in quality.

An Item Flaw makes the trapping a little worse, but easier to find.</p><h3>Item Qualities</h3><p>A Trapping is called a Quality Trapping if it has more Item Qualities than Flaws. For each Item Quality the Trapping has, double its price and make it one step less available. A Trapping with more Qualities than its Encumbrance, and that lacks any Flaws, is called a Best Quality Trapping.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>A spade that has the Fine and Durable Item Qualities costs quadruple the list price, and drops availability from Common to Rare.</em></p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/city-night.webp\" width=\"225\" height=\"292\" /></div><h4>Durable</h4><p>Laboriously crafted using strong materials, the item can take +Durable Damage points before it suffers any negatives (see @UUID[.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#weapon-damage]{Weapon Damage} and @UUID[.yYXaAw24i93B4vzk#armour-damage]{Armour Damage}) and gains a saving throw of 9+ on a 1d10 roll against instant breakage from sources like Trap Blade (see @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8]{Weapons}). This Quality can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the saving throw improves by 1 (e.g. From 9+ to 8+).</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Molli owns a high quality sword with Durable 3, meaning it can take 3 Damage before suffering any negatives, and has a saving throw of 7+ against breaking. </em></p><h4>Fine</h4><p>Meticulously crafted to please the eye. This Quality is a sign of social status and can be taken multiple times. The higher the quality, the more impressive it seems.</p><h4>Lightweight</h4><p>Cleverly crafted for ease of carrying. Reduce Encumbrance points by 1.</p><h4>Practical</h4><p>Expertly crafted with utility in mind. A failed test using this item receives +1 SL. If the item is a piece of armour, any penalties for wearing it are reduced by one level (for example from −30 to −20).</p><h3>Item Flaws</h3><p>A Trapping is called a Flawed Trapping if it has more Item Flaws than Qualities. Each Flaw halves the listed price and improves Availability by one step. Many vendors sell flawed items, but pretend they are anything but. A successful Test with any appropriate skill — such as Evaluate, or Melee for weapons, or Trade for tools — will spot such underhanded activities.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Exotic items do not have their Availability modified by being Flawed — they are always difficult to find, even shoddy examples.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>A suit of chainmail that is both Bulky and Unreliable costs a quarter of the list price, and raises Availability from Rare to Common.</em></p><h4>Ugly</h4><p>Crafted without any aesthetic awareness whatsoever, Ugly items attract negative attention, and related Fellowship Tests might even suffer a –10 penalty.</p><h4>Shoddy</h4><p>Hastily crafted by an amateur or fraudster. The item breaks when used in any failed Test rolling a double. Similarly, Shoddy armour breaks if any Critical Hit is sustained to a Hit Location it protects.</p><h4>Unreliable</h4><p>Crafted without attention to functionality, a failed test using this item receives –1 SL. Further, penalties for wearing Unreliable armour are doubled.</p><h4>Bulky</h4><p>An awkward design crafted clumsily. Increase Encumbrance by +1 (small trinkets cannot normally have this flaw).

All other Blackpowder and Engineering weapons use bullets.</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/weapons.webp\" width=\"173\" height=\"267\" /></div><h3>Weapon Damage</h3><p>Some @Table[oops]{Fumble results} or spells may damage your weapon. For each point of damage your weapon receives, reduce its Damage by –1. If the Damage is reduced to +0 (or SB +0), the weapon is mangled beyond all recognition, and now counts as an Improvised Weapon. If an Improvised Weapon is Damaged, it is considered useless for melee combat.</p><p>Weapons can be fixed by appropriate Artisans for 10% of the weapon’s cost per damage point sustained. Weapons reduced to Improvised Weapons cannot be fixed. You can also repair your own weapons if you have the appropriate Trade Skill, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.trappings.OD83JAlc9KhDpHK5]{Trade Tools} and, for more than a single point of Damage, a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.trappings.ixOMVrEC1ISyYdDU]{Workshop}.</p><h3>Melee Weapon Groups</h3><p>All melee weapons are assigned to a Weapon Group. Each Weapon Group requires a separate skill to master its use.  So, Melee (Flail) allows you to use Flails and is a separate skill from Melee (Polearm), which allows you to use Polearms. If you use a weapon from a Group where you have no Advances, you Test your Weapon Skill to hit with the weapon. While you still suffer all the weapon’s Flaws, you cannot use any of its Qualities. Some Melee Weapon Groups also have special rules.</p><h4>Cavalry</h4><p>Cavalry weapons are assumed to be used when mounted. When not used from horse-back, all two-handed weapons in the Cavalry Weapon Group also count as Two-Handed weapons. Single-handed Cavalry weapons are not normally used when unmounted.</p><h4>Flail</h4><p>Unskilled characters add the @UUID[.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#dangerous]{Dangerous} Weapon Flaw to their Flails, and the other listed Weapon Qualities are not used.</p><h4>Parry</h4><p>Any one-handed weapon with the @UUID[.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#defensive]{Defensive} Quality can be used with Melee (Parry). When using Melee (Parry), a weapon can be used to Oppose an incoming attack without the normal –20 off-hand penalty (see @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#two-weapon-fighting]{Two-Weapon Fighting}).</p><h3>Weapon Reach</h3><p>The lengths of the weapons are progressively bigger as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>Personal</strong>: Your legs and fists, perhaps your head, and anything attached to those.</li><li><strong>Very Short</strong>: Less than a foot in length.</li><li><strong>Short</strong>: Up to 2 feet in length.</li><li><strong>Average</strong>: Up to 3 feet long.</li><li><strong>Long</strong>: Up to 6 foot long.</li><li><strong>Very Long</strong>: Up to 10 feet in length; can Engage enemies up to 4 yards away, rather than just 2.</li><li><strong>Massive</strong>: Anything over 10 feet long; can Engage enemies up to 6 yards away, rather than just 2.</li></ul><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h4 class=\"sidebar-title\" style=\"text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Options: Weapon Length and In-Fighting</em></h4><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">These are simple rules for those who like to use Weapon length for more than simple description of appearance, and a possible impediment to fitting down dark tunnels.</span></p><h4 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Weapon Length</em></h4><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><em>If your weapon is longer than your opponents’, they suffer a penalty of –10 to hit you as you find it easier to keep them at bay.</em></span></p><h4 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>In-Fighting</em></h4><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><em>As your Action, you can perform an Opposed Melee Test to attempt to step inside your opponent’s weapon length. The winner chooses if combat continues as normal or as ‘in-fighting’. During in-fighting, any weapon longer than Short counts as an Improvised weapon.</em></span></p></blockquote><h3>Ranged Weapon Groups</h3><p>Ranged weapons are difficult to master. You cannot attempt a Ranged Test for a weapon you do not have the correct speciality for. So, if you know Ranged (Blackpowder), you cannot attempt a Ranged (Bow) Test. However, there are a few exceptions.</p><h4>Blackpowder and Explosives</h4><p>Those with Ranged (Engineering) can use Blackpowder and Explosive weapons without penalty.</p><h4>Crossbows and Throwing</h4><p>Crossbows and Thrown weapons are relatively simple to use. You can attempt a Ranged (Crossbow) or Ranged (Throwing) Test using your Ballistic Skill, but the weapon loses all Qualities whilst retaining its Flaws.</p><h4>Engineering</h4><p>All Engineering weapons can be used by characters with Ranged (Blackpowder), but the weapons lose all Weapon Qualities whilst retaining their flaws.</p><h3>Weapon Range</h3><p>A weapon’s range is its medium range in yards. @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#ranged-combat]{Rules} presents modifiers if a weapon is at Point Blank, Short, Long, or Extreme range. Calculate ranges as follows:</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Calculating Range Bands</span></h3><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Point Blank = Range ÷ 10</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Short = Range ÷ 2</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Long = Range x 2</em></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Extreme = Range x 3</em></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>Click on the weapon's range in the Combat tab to see a breakdown of the range bands for that weapon.</p></blockquote><h3>Weapon Qualities</h3><p>Some weapons have specific advantages over others, which are described with Weapon Qualities.</p><h4>Accurate</h4><p>The weapon is accurate and easy to hit with. Gain a bonus of +10 to any Test when firing this weapon.</p><h4>Blackpowder</h4><p>The crack of gunfire followed by gouts of smoke and confusion can be terrifying. If you are targeted by a Blackpowder weapon, you must pass an <strong>Average (+20) Cool</strong> Test or take a @Condition[Broken] Condition, even if the shot misses.</p><h4>Blast (Rating)</h4><p>All Characters within (Rating) yards of the struck target point take SL+Weapon Damage, and suffer any Conditions the weapon inflicts.</p><h4>Damaging</h4><p>A Damaging weapon can use the higher score from either the units die or the SL to determine the Damage caused from a successful hit. For example, if you roll 34 in your attack Test and the target number was 52 you can choose to use the SL, which in this case is 2, or the units die result, which is 4. An Undamaging weapon can never also be Damaging (Undamaging takes precedent).</p><h4>Defensive</h4><p>Defensive weapons are designed to parry incoming attacks. If you are wielding such a weapon, gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Melee Test when you oppose an incoming attack.</p><h4>Distract</h4><p>Distracting weapons can be used to drive an opponent back due to their dangerous or whip-like natures. Instead of causing Damage, a successful attack with a Distracting weapon can force an opponent back 1 yard per SL by which you win the Opposed Test.</p><h4>Entangle</h4><p>Your weapon wraps around your opponents, entangling them. Any opponent successfully hit by your weapon gains the @Condition[Entangled] Condition with a Strength value equal to your Strength Characteristic. When Entangling an opponent, you cannot otherwise use the weapon to hit. You can end the Entangling whenever you wish.</p><h4>Fast</h4><p>Fast weapons are designed to strike out with such speed that parrying is not an option, leaving an opponent skewered before they can react. A wielder of a Fast weapon can choose to attack with the Fast weapon outside of the normal Initiative sequence, either striking first, last, or somewhere in between as desired. </p><p>Further, all Melee Tests to defend against Fast weapons suffer a penalty of –10 if your opponent is using a weapon without the Fast Quality; other Skills defend as normal. Two opponents with Fast weapons fight in Initiative order (relative to each other) as normal. A Fast weapon may never also be Slow (Slow takes precedent).</p><h4>Hack</h4><p>Hacking weapons have heavy blades that can hack through armour with horrific ease. If you hit an opponent, you Damage a struck piece of armour or shield by 1 point as well as wounding the target.</p><h4>Impact</h4><p>Some weapons are just huge or cause terrible damage due to their weight or design. On a successful hit, add the result of the units die of the attack roll to any Damage caused by an Impact weapon. An @UUID[.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#undamaging]{Undamaging} weapon can never also have Impact (Undamaging takes precedent).</p><h4>Impale</h4><p>Impale weapons can kill with a single clean blow. Impale weapons cause a @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#criticals]{Critical Hit} on any number divisible by 10 (i.e.: 10, 20, 30, etc.) as well as on doubles (i.e.: 11, 22, 33) rolled equal or under an appropriate Test in combat. </p><p>If the impale comes from a ranged weapon, the ammunition used has firmly lodged itself in the target’s body. Arrows and bolts require a successful <strong>Challenging (+0) Heal</strong> Test to remove — bullets require a surgeon (see the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-akoris.talents.NP4EHyyh1yOLbsPU]{Surgery}  Talent). You cannot heal 1 of your Wounds for each unremoved arrow or bullet.</p><h4>Penetrating</h4><p>The weapon is highly effective at penetrating armour. Non-metal APs are ignored, and the first point of all other armour is ignored.</p><h4>Pistol</h4><p>You can use this weapon to attack in Close Combat.</p><h4>Precise</h4><p>The weapon is easy to get on target. Gain a bonus of +1 SL to any successful Test when attacking with this weapon.</p><h4>Pummel</h4><p>Pummel weapons are especially good at battering foes into submission. If you score a Head hit with a Pummel weapon, attempt an <strong>Opposed Strength/Endurance</strong> Test against the struck opponent. If you win the test, your opponent gains a @Condition[Stunned] Condition.</p><h4>Repeater (Rating)</h4><p>Your weapon holds (Rating) shots, automatically reloading after each time you fire. When you use all your shots, you must fully reload the weapon using the normal rules.</p><h4>Shield (Rating)</h4><p>If you use this weapon to oppose an incoming attack, you count as having (Rating) Armour Points on all locations of your body. If your weapon has a Shield Rating of 2 or higher (so: Shield 2 or Shield 3), you may also Oppose incoming missile shots in your Line of Sight.</p><h4>Trap Blade</h4><p>Some weapons are designed to trap other weapons, and sometimes even break them. If you score a Critical when defending against an attack from a bladed weapon you can choose to trap it instead of causing a Critical Hit.</p><p>If you choose to do this, enact an <strong>Opposed Strength</strong> Test, adding your SL from the previous Melee Test. If you succeed, your opponent drops the blade as it is yanked free. If you score an Astounding Success, you not only disarm your opponent, but the force of your maneuver breaks their blade unless it has the Unbreakable quality. If you fail the Test, your opponent frees the blade and may fight on as normal.</p><h4>Unbreakable</h4><p>The weapon is exquisitely well-made or constructed from an especially strong material. Under almost all circumstances, this weapon will not break, corrode, or lose its edge.</p><h4>Wrap</h4><p>Wrap weapons typically have long chains with weights at the end, making it very difficult to parry them effectively. Melee Tests opposing an attack from a Wrap weapon suffer a penalty of –1 SL, as parried strikes wrap over the top of shields, or around blades.</p><h3>Weapon Flaws</h3><p>Some weapons are just difficult to use, or simply dangerous, as described with Weapon Flaws.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/artillery.webp\" width=\"166\" height=\"188\" /><h4>Dangerous</h4><p>Some weapons are almost as likely to hurt you as your opponent. Any failed test including an 9 on either 10s or units die results in a Fumble (see @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#fumbles]{Rules} for more on Fumbles).</p><h4>Imprecise</h4><p>Imprecise weapons are difficult to bring to bear as they are unwieldy or hard to aim. Suffer a penalty of –1 SL when using the weapon to attack. An Imprecise Weapon can never be @UUID[.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#precise]{Precise} (Imprecise takes precedent).</p><h4>Reload (Rating)</h4><p>The weapon is slow to reload. An unloaded weapon with this flaw requires an Extended Ranged Test for the appropriate Weapon Group scoring (Rating) SL to reload. If you are interrupted while reloading, you must start again from scratch.</p><h4>Slow</h4><p>Slow weapons are unwieldy and heavy, making them difficult to use properly. Characters using Slow weapons always strike last in a Round, regardless of Initiative order. Further, opponents gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Test to defend against your attacks.</p><h4>Tiring</h4><p>The weapon is fatiguing to use or difficult to bring to bear. You only gain the benefit of the @UUID[.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#impact]{Impact} and @UUID[.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#damaging]{Damaging} Weapon Traits on a Turn you @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.bdfiyhEYtKs7irqc#charging]{Charge}.</p><h4>Undamaging</h4><p>Some weapons are not very good at penetrating armour. All APs are doubled against Undamaging weapons. Further, you do not automatically inflict a minimum of 1 Wound on a successful hit in combat.</p></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"wdXywmb7FBVipOw8","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":700000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ru9YEZPK1fEoiXMO.JournalEntryPage.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":2},"system":{}},{"name":"Armour","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>First off, avoid all contact.

rains down on your armour, it can be damaged, possibly permanently. Whenever you are instructed to damage a piece of armour, the APs in the location damaged are reduced by 1. </p><p>If this lowers the APs to 0 in that location, the armour there is rendered useless.</p><p>Armour is generally damaged in one of two ways: </p><ul><li><p>A special ability triggers, such as a spell or Talent, damaging a piece of armour</p></li><li><p>A Critical Wound is deflected</p></li></ul><h4>Critical Deflection</h4><p>This only occurs should you choose it to. If you suffer a Critical Wound from an incoming attack on a location protected by armour, you can choose to let your armour be damaged by 1AP in order to ignore the Critical Wound. </p><p>You still suffer all normal Wounds (and given your APs are now 1 point lower, you probably suffer an extra Wound), but you avoid the Critical Wound effects as the blow is absorbed by your now-damaged armour.</p><h4>Repairing Armour</h4><p>It costs 10% of the armour’s base price per AP lost to repair it. So, if you had a Sleeved Chainmail Coat with 1AP of damage on the Body, and 1AP of damage on the Arms, it will cost you 20% of your armour’s base cost to fix it, in this case 12/–. If a section of your armour is completely broken, it will cost you 30% of the armour’s base cost to fix, and you’ll likely be waiting some time before it’s completed. </p><p>You can also repair your own armour if you have the appropriate Trade Skill, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.trappings.OD83JAlc9KhDpHK5]{Trade Tools} and, for Plate Armour, a @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.trappings.ixOMVrEC1ISyYdDU]{Workshop}.</p><h3>Armour Qualities</h3><p>Armour can possess the following Armour Qualities:</p><h4>Flexible</h4><p>Flexible armour can be worn under a layer of non-Flexible armour if you wish. If you do so, you gain the benefit of both.</p><h4>Impenetrable</h4><p>The armour is especially resilient, meaning most attacks simply cannot penetrate it. All Critical Wounds caused by an odd number to hit you, such as 11 or 33, are ignored.</p><h3>Armour Flaws</h3><p>Some armours have points of weakness, as described by Armour Flaws.</p><h4>Partial</h4><p>The armour does not cover the entire hit location. An opponent that rolls an even number to hit, or rolls a @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.wmA76Q2zJJ9HrkvA#criticals]{Critical Hit}, ignores the partial armour’s APs.</p><h4>Weakpoints</h4><p>The armour has small weakpoints where a blade can slip in if your opponent is sufficiently skilled or lucky. If your opponent has a weapon with the @UUID[.wdXywmb7FBVipOw8#impale]{Impale} Quality and scores a Critical, the APs of your armour are ignored.</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"yYXaAw24i93B4vzk","image":{},"video":{"volume":0.5,"controls":true},"src":null,"sort":800000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.10LxsWBSwEmjZWeV.JournalEntryPage.yYXaAw24i93B4vzk"}},"title":{"show":true,"level":2},"system":{}},{"name":"Packs and Containers","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Trappings can be packed into backpacks, sacks, and pouches, making them easier to carry.

It describes your training, social class, and your future prospects. <strong>WFRP </strong>groups similar Careers into Classes.</p><h2>Classes</h2><p>A summary of each Class is found in @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.bS2sxusEp1FEqmRk]{Character}. Classes organise Careers into easily referenced groups. They also impact character development, provide different starting Trappings during @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.hQipqLYlbBEjJEWL]{Character Creation}, and influence how you can change Career (see @UUID[.84Aj04uEEBh3yTS3#changing-career]{Changing Career}). Some Classes have access to different Endeavours — activities you can take @UUID[JournalEntry.gLDW6JBuoYuzCoya]{between adventures}.</p><h2>Careers</h2><p>The summary and illustration at the top of the eight Careers in your chosen Class should give you a good idea of which is the one for you. The Careers can be considered to be as broad as possible, so you are encouraged to interpret them imaginatively as part of your Character concept.</p><div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/coachman.webp\" /></div><h3>Career Levels</h3><p>Every Career has four levels, each progressively better than the last. If you take a look at Apothecary, the first Academic Career, you can see the four levels are: </p><ul><li><em>Apprentice Apothecary</em></li><li><em>Apothecary</em></li><li><em>Master Apothecary</em></li><li><em>Apothecary-General</em></li></ul><p>When choosing a Career for a new character, you always start at the first level of the career — so, if you were an Apothecary, you would start as an <em>Apprentice Apothecary</em>. </p><h3>Advancing Through Your Career</h3><p>Your Character’s Career affects how they will grow through experience. Every Career offers three forms of Advances: <em>Characteristic Advances</em>, <em>Skill Advances</em>, and <em>Talent Advances</em> — each of which are purchased with Experience Points (XP). You can also use XP to Change Career. Your Career Level determines what Characteristics, Skills, and Talents are available to you.</p><h4>Characteristic Advances</h4><p>Every Career has an Advance Scheme governing its Characteristic Advances. The Advance Scheme shows your character’s 10 Characteristics, 3 marked with <span style=\"font-family:CaslonPro\"><strong>✠</strong></span>, 1 marked with <span style=\"font-family:CaslonPro\"><strong>♟</strong></span>, 1 marked with <span style=\"font-family:CaslonPro\"><strong>♜</strong></span>, and the last marked with <span style=\"font-family:CaslonPro\"><strong>♛</strong></span>.</p><p>The three marked <span style=\"font-family:CaslonPro\"><strong>✠</strong></span> are Characteristics you can advance in the first level of the Career. When you enter the second level of a career, the <span style=\"font-family:CaslonPro\"><strong>♟</strong></span><strong> </strong>Characteristic also becomes available. When you enter the third level, the <span style=\"font-family:CaslonPro\"><strong>♜</strong></span><strong> </strong>Characteristic also becomes available. And when you enter the fourth and last level of a Career, the <span style=\"font-family:CaslonPro\"><strong>♛</strong></span> Characteristic finally becomes available.</p><p><strong>The cost in XP of a Characteristic Advance is shown in the </strong><em><strong>Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs</strong></em><strong> table, and depends on the number of Characteristic Advances you have already taken in that Characteristic.</strong></p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>The cost in XP of a Characteristic Advance is also shown by hovering over the advancement indicator (the <strong>+</strong> or <strong>✓</strong> symbol) on your character sheet.</p></blockquote><p>Each Characteristic Advance adds +1 to the associated Characteristic. So, if you had purchased 4 Agility Advances, and your Initial Agility was 27, your Current Agility would be 31. The Advances would cost 25 XP per +1 Advance, as at each point the number of Advances previously taken would be in the 0–5 range.</p><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX]{Rules} explains how the Characteristics are used in the game, and @UUID[JournalEntry.IQ0PgoJihQltCBUU.JournalEntryPage.GaZa9sU4KjKDswMr]{Character} explains what each Characteristic is. There is no upper limit to the number of Characteristic Advances that can be purchased, although higher levels do become prohibitively expensive. <strong>Note</strong>: While Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill have the word ‘Skill’ in them, this is only a historical artefact — they are characteristics and are Advanced as such.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs</span></h3><table style=\"width:100%;height:289px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"> </td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\" colspan=\"2\"><em><strong>XP Cost per Advance</strong></em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em><strong>Advances</strong></em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em><strong>Characteristics</strong></em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em><strong>Skills</strong></em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>0 to 5</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>25</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>10</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>6 to 10</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>30</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>15</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>11 to 15</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>40</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>20</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>16 to 20</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>50</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>30</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>21 to 25</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>70</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>40</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>26 to 30</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>90</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>60</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>31 to 35</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>120</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>80</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>36 to 40</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>150</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>110</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>41 to 45</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>190</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>140</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>46 to 50</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>230</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>180</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>51 to 55</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>280</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>220</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>56 to 60</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>330</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>270</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>61 to 65</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>390</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>320</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>66 to 70</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>450</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>380</em></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>70+</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>520</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><em>440</em></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><h4>Skill Advances</h4><p>You can advance all the Skills listed for your Career level and lower.

But, if you were a Master Apothecary (level 3), you could access all the Skills for Master Apothecary (level 3), Apothecary (level 2), and Apprentice Apothecary (level 1).</p><p><strong>The cost in XP of a Skill Advance is shown in the </strong><em><strong>Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs</strong></em><strong> table, and depends on the number of Skill Advances you have already taken in that Skill.</strong></p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>The cost in XP of a Skill Advance is also shown by hovering over the advancement indicator (the <strong>+</strong> or <strong>✓</strong> symbol) on your character sheet.</p></blockquote><p>Each Skill Advance adds +1 to your Skill level. Therefore, if you had purchased 9 Advances in Stealth and your Agility was 31, your Stealth would be 40. The first 5 Advances would cost 10 XP each, and the 4 remaining Advances would cost 15 XP each.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: One of the Skills in the first level of your Career will be marked in italics. This is the Skill you Test when @UUID[.R7RQ4hfivLrG0XaF#earning-money-with-status]{Earning} money. </p><p>Like Characteristic Advances, there is no upper limit to the number of Skill Advances that can be purchased.</p><h4>Talent Advances</h4><p>Talents are only available when you are in the level of the Career that lists them. So, if you are an Apothecary-General, you can only buy Talents listed under Apothecary-General, not those listed under Apprentice Apothecary, Apothecary, or Master Apothecary.</p><p><strong>Talents Advances cost 100 XP +100 XP per Advance already taken in that Talent.</strong></p><p>The rules for every Talent can be found in @UUID[JournalEntry.6zOdTLv3YeYeJ4hR]{Skills and Talents}. The first time you purchase a new Talent (for 100 XP) it grants you access to the Talent’s special rules. If you purchase a Talent multiple times (second time costs 200 XP, third 300 XP) any additional abilities bestowed are listed in the Talent description.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all Talents can be purchased multiple times. Check the Talent listing for any limitations.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Non-Career Advances</em></h3><p><em>Characters will inevitably want to advance Characteristics and Skills not listed in their Careers.

If you have, changing Career costs 100 XP. If you have not, it costs 200 XP.</p><h4>Completing a Career</h4><p>Completing a Career represents mastering your current vocation and being ready to move on to something new. To complete a Career, you must have the number of Advances listed below in all your Career level’s Characteristics and in eight of your Career level’s available Skills. You must also have at least 1 Talent from your current Career level. Skills and Talents you have gained from advancement prior to entering your current Career count towards this..</p><table style=\"height:109px;width:19.0642%\" border=\"\\\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:16px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\"><strong>Level</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\"><strong>Advances</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height:16px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">1</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">5</td></tr><tr style=\"height:16px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">2</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">10</td></tr><tr style=\"height:16px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">3</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">15</td></tr><tr style=\"height:16px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:37.0313%\">4</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:16px;width:62.1875%\">20</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Note</strong>: Just because you have completed a Career level does not mean you have to move to a new one. Moving Career is always entirely up to you. If you wish to stay in the first level of Pauper forever, that’s completely fine.</p><blockquote class=\"foundry-note\"><p>When a skill or characteristic has received the required number of advances to be considered complete in the current career, the advancement indicator changes from a <strong>+ </strong>symbol to a <strong>✓</strong> symbol</p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Options: Customize Your Trappings</em></h3><p><em>The Trappings listed in each Career are guidelines only. Feel free to be creative with your Trappings, choosing those that fit your interpretation of your character’s Career and how it manifests.

Similarly, if you are trying to use the authority of your Career, not having the trappings of such means people might not take you seriously.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Changing to a New Level</h4><p>If you have completed your current Career level, you can enter the next Career level, or any lower Career level, for 100 XP. So, if you completed Hunter (Hunter level 2), you could exit to Tracker (Hunter level 3) or Trapper (Hunter level 1) for 100 XP, but not Huntsmaster (Hunter level 4).</p><p>With GM permission, you can also skip Career levels. This is normally driven by in-game events. For example: A Scion (Noble level 1) inherits a significant estate during play, so the GM offers Noble Lord (Noble level 4) as a potential change of Career. Like normal, changing to this Career level costs 100 XP if you have completed your current Career level, or 200 XP if you have not.</p><h4>Changing to a New Career</h4><p>If you have completed your current Career level, you can enter the first level of any Career from your Class for 100 XP, or for 200 XP if you have not completed your current Career level. If you want to enter the first level of a Career from a different Class, this cost an extra 100 XP. Note: your GM may require in-game justification for such Career changes; after all, not just anyone can enter Noble, even if you are in the Courtier Class.</p><p>Further, if you have completed your current Career level, with GM permission, and solid justification, you can enter the same Career level in any Career within your Class. So, if you completed Master Apothecary (Apothecary level 3), you could move to Fellow (Scholar level 3), to show you were taking a teaching position in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.altdorf-journals.NARo7y1h82hx3cIV]{Altdorf University}.

Most people in between are acutely aware of their standing, and preoccupied with improving it. This is represented by Status, which can modify the interactions between people of different social classes.</p>\n<h3>Tiers and Standing</h3>\n<p>Status is expressed as a Tier — from lowest to highest: Brass, Silver, or Gold — and a Standing — which is a number, generally from 1–5, showing how respected the character is within their Tier.</p>\n<p>If you have a higher Tier than another character, you have higher Status. If you are in the same Tier as another character, then you are higher Status if you have a higher Standing.</p>\n<h4>The Three Tiers</h4>\n<p>The most important distinctions in Status are the three Tiers:</p>\n<p><strong>The Gold Tier</strong>: Reserved for the rulers of society; those who directly serve them as advisors, protectors, and maintainers of the law; and the independently wealthy. To reach this position requires hard work, success, and not a little luck. All in the Gold tier are rich, respected, and of higher Status than those in the Silver and Brass tiers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Silver Tier</strong>: Populated by well-to-do townsfolk and those following professions requiring skill and expertise. Tradesmen, craftsmen, and merchants make up most of the upper ranks of the tier, whilst the bottom is filled by those providing services. These folk lead relatively humble lives, but they are still respectable. People of the Silver Tier are of higher Status than those of the Brass Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>The Brass Tier</strong>: Occupied by peasants and those in the poorest professions which often require no particular skills. The Brass Tier also contains many criminals, ne’er-do-wells, and those who don’t make any living at all.</p>\n<h3>Determining Status</h3>\n<p>Your Status is determined by your Career level. Beside the name of your Career level is your Status, marked as ‘Brass 3’, ‘Silver 1’, or similar. This is the Tier and Standing. Should you change Career, check the new Status by the name of your new Career Level, and mark it on your Character Sheet.</p>\n<h3>Changing Status</h3>\n<p>Status changes for the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You change Career.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You gain a Talent that modifies Status.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The GM imposes a change in Status due to in-game events.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Whatever causes a change in Status, you should take time to explain what exactly occurred, and the impact this has on your character. If you have changed to a different Career Level, say from a Student to a Scholar, what precipitated this? What subject did you study? And how does your character now feel after graduating? Taking time to explain your changing circumstances makes your character more rounded and believable.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>BEYOND THE SOCIAL NORM</em></h3>\n<p><em>Status provides a rough guide to how the folk of the Old World behave when they fit in with acceptable norms. However, some characters will violate this, and that’s completely fine. If you wish to randomise how an NPC reacts to Social Status, roll 1d10 on the following table:</em></p>\n<p><em>@Table[social-norm]{Beyond the Social Norm}</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image\"><img class=\"fit\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/bribe.webp\" /></div>\n<h3>The Effects of Status</h3>\n<p>Status influences a number of situations that impact your Character. Often these involve making Tests easier or @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.lQThXbnpgQ30VBXR#difficulty]{more difficult}. The GM may expand or limit these influences as they wish.</p>\n<h4>Charm</h4>\n<p>Status impacts Charm significantly, with those of higher Status more easily able to get what they want, and those of lower status finding it harder to secure influence. In most circumstances, those of a higher Tier gain a bonus of +10 to Charm Tests influencing those with a lower tier. Similarly, those of lower Tier suffer a penalty of –10 to influence those of a higher Tier. The GM may also apply these modifiers to those of different Standing in the same Tier, but this is rarer.</p>\n<p>If the target of the Charm attempt is atypical, this might not work as usual however. An individual who ‘Defies Status’ would mean no modifiers apply, and one with ‘Extreme Views’ might mean that the opposite modifiers apply (–10 rather than +10, for example).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>OPTIONS: BEGGING &amp; STATUS</em></h3>\n<p><em>Begging is often most effective when aimed at those who are just above you in the social order.</em></p>\n<p><em>For example: Most Beggars are Brass Tier and therefore benefit from a +10 bonus when begging from people who are Silver Tier, instead of suffering a –10 penalty.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Entertain</h4>\n<p>Status does not normally influence Entertain tests. However, a GM ought to consider that some entertainments are thought fitting to particular venues. A peasant playing a hurdy-gurdy is not likely to go down well at an opera house, whilst even a mediocre orchestra is likely to draw a significant audience if it starts performing on the village green.</p>\n<p>As such the GM might like to consider the sort of audience a performance is normally aimed at, and the audience that is actually available, and apply suitable modifiers.</p>\n<h4>Intimidate</h4>\n<p>If you have a higher Status than the target of your Intimidate, you typically gain a bonus of +10.</p>\n<h4>Gossip</h4>\n<p>Gossip tends to be stilted between people of different classes. Any Gossip Test between individuals of different Tiers suffers a penalty of –10.</p>\n<h4>Leadership</h4>\n<p>Status plays a very important role in Leadership. Indeed, the State Army normally only grants higher ranks to those of noble birth.</p>\n<p>If you are a higher tier than the target of your Leadership Test, you gain a bonus of +10. If you are two tiers higher, the bonus increases to +20.</p>\n<h3>Maintaining Status</h3>\n<p>In order to benefit (or suffer) from Status, you have to act in accordance with your role in society.</p>\n<p>It may be that you wish to pass incognito, presenting yourself anonymously. Typically, you will be counted as having a Status of Brass 3 if you do this.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Hans the noble wears the latest fashions and always buys the best trappings. He rides his lovingly groomed horse into a village, pausing only to let his herald announce his presence to all. He fully benefits from his Gold 2 Status. His brother Heinrich dresses in old clothes, hides all his courtly garb under the bed, and acts like a nameless wanderer. He is treated as having a Status of Brass 3.</em></p>\n<h4>Keeping Up Appearances</h4>\n<p>Characters need to spend a certain amount of money to maintain their lifestyle. As explained in @UUID[JournalEntry.sLomXnc8R8518cWN.JournalEntryPage.cwM5veYnAbSjlrvv#the-cost-of-living]{The Cost of Living} there are minimum expectations of expenditure for each Tier.</p>\n<p>Should a character fail to live up to these levels of expenditure they will begin to be perceived as being of lower Status, losing 1 point of Standing per week.</p>\n<p>To stop this decline, the character must resume spending the money expected of them, whereupon they regain 1 point of Standing a week until they recover the lost points.</p>\n<p>Should Standing reach 0, your tier drops by one and your Standing is set to 5. If you are already at the lowest tier, then your Status sticks at Brass 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Pietr is a Noble and has been slumming it in the East End of Altdorf for the last two weeks, letting his Standing of Gold 3 drop to Gold 1 as he eats poor food, drinks cheap beer, and hostels in flop houses. Should another week pass and Pietr does not change his ways, his Standing will drop to Gold 0, which immediately becomes Silver 5. Should this occur, Pietr’s father will almost certainly step in to curtail the family shame…</em></p>\n<h3>Earning Money with Status</h3>\n<p>Your Status is directly linked to the amount of money you earn while working. The higher your Status, the more money you can earn as your good name attracts business. If the GM agrees, during play you can spend a week to work in your Career assuming you are in a place where such is feasible (it’s hard to be a Watchman in the middle of a wasteland). This is called Earning.</p>\n<p>When Earning, make an <strong>Average (+20) Dramatic</strong> Test (see @UUID[JournalEntry.NS3YGlJQxwTggjRX.JournalEntryPage.lQThXbnpgQ30VBXR#dramatic-tests]{Dramatic Tests}) against the Earning Skill of your Career (the Skill marked in italics in the Career’s first level). If passed, you receive the money marked in the table below. If failed, you receive half the money. If an Astounding Failure (–6) is scored, you have a very bad week, and earn nothing (or have your money stolen, or some similar mishap).</p>\n<p>This total is not strictly speaking how much money you earn, it’s more a representation of how much money you have left at the end of the week after all your expenses are taken into account.</p>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:68px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:16.7255%;height:17px\"><strong>Tier</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:82.333%;height:17px\"><strong>Amount Earned per Standing</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:16.7255%;height:17px\">Brass</td>\n<td style=\"width:82.333%;height:17px\">2d10 Brass Pennies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:16.7255%;height:17px\">Silver</td>\n<td style=\"width:82.333%;height:17px\">1d10 Silver Shillings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:16.7255%;height:17px\">Gold</td>\n<td style=\"width:82.333%;height:17px\">1 Gold Crown</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is the same amount of coin earned with an @UUID[JournalEntry.gLDW6JBuoYuzCoya.JournalEntryPage.JX9ifRlgzzGrU2zh]{Income} Endeavour.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>Gunther the Coachman decides he’ll work for the Four Seasons Coaching House for a week while his peers research a library for things he frankly doesn’t understand, and secretly thinks may be heretical if he did. The GM agrees to let Gunther enact some Earning, so Gunther rolls against his Drive (Coach) skill (his Earning Skill for Coachman) and passes. Given his Status is Silver 2, he can roll 2d10 and earn that much silver. Unfortunately, he only rolls a 1 and a 2 for a total of 3 silver shillings; clearly Gunther was drinking a lot after his long work shifts, and has little coin remaining…</em></p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\"><em>GENDERED CAREER NAMES</em></h3>\n<p><em>Although some Careers have masculine or feminine names because of the limitations of language, all careers are intended for any gender; so, no matter how your character identifies, all careers are available.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>For example</strong>: Anyone may serve any deity. Although some Gods (such as Taal and Ulric, and Rhya and Shallya) are more likely to have servants who identify with the same gender as the God, other deities (such as Verena and Sigmar), have an equal appeal to all.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/spot-scroll.webp\" width=\"308\" height=\"248\" /></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"name":"Rat Catcher","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><div><div><p>See there by the midden-heap, Otmar?

When apprenticed, Rat Catchers usually adopt a stray puppy that they train for ratting. The toughest Rat Catchers are hired by towns as Sewer Jacks to hunt giant rats and other subterranean nasties.

In the cities, organized fights take place every night. There is money to be made charging spectators, and even more in gambling on the result. Winners earn coin and are celebrated as local heroes. Losers are hurt or killed. Because pit fighting is officially frowned upon, the fights are often controlled by criminal gangs, but the rich love to slum it on occasion, especially if it involves a little bloodshed. The gladiators of Tilea are the most renowned pit fighters, though the chain-fighters of Marienburg and bear-wrestlers of Kislev draw a crowd. Pugilists and wrestlers might work a travelling fair, challenging the public to survive three minutes in the ring with them, or they might fight a celebrated opponent in front of cheering crowds. Knives, clubs, chains, boxing, wrestling, there is an almost endless variation of styles and codes a Pit Fighter might adopt.</p><p>Many Pit Fighters fall into their sport because they have the talent and they simply need the money. Some would jump at the chance to leave their seedy world behind and put their talents to a slightly better use. Fortunately, Pit fighters are generally free to use their time as they will, provided they turn up on time for the next big fight, and even if they don’t, there is always another

Elves and Dwarfs have little care for the boundaries of men and will occasionally venture deep into Human territory tracking a challenging prize. Stories of the Wood Elves’ Wild Hunt petrify children of the Grey Mountains, and not without cause, for if any intruder strays too close to Elven lands, then the hunters quickly become the hunted.</p><p>A common punishment for hunter caught poaching is to lose two fingers. Faced with being unable to draw a bow, many will cut and run before the punishment can be administered, preferring to take a chance in the forests. Around the fertile villages of the Suden Vorbergland, Hunters are losing ground to farmers as the trees are cut back and nobles reserve what hunting is left for sport. The Imperial Army is always on the lookout for reliable, local hunters to support their army as they march, acting as support archers or scouts.

Secular Witch Hunters are sometimes employed by provincial government, though these are little more than specialist bounty hunters.

you think only Magisters can wield magic? Think again! I, too, have such understanding, and I refuse to become a slave to the so-called Colleges.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Apprentice Franz Zimmel of the Gold Order, 3 months before being captured by a Witch Hunter</em></p></div></div></blockquote><p> </p><div><div><div><p><em>Willful and ambitious, you strive to master magic without an officially sanctioned license to operate</em></p><p>Any with the rare talent to wield magic must, by law, be trained by Magisters of the College of Magic. Not everyone accepts such a fate; some hide their powers or go on the run. Such folk are called Witches. They risk insanity and damnation as magic burns through them without correct tutelage, and rarely understand the nature of the forces in which they dabble. Others embrace their burgeoning powers wholeheartedly, accepting the risks. Witches come in all varieties, with the talent to wield magic playing no favorites. Some are benign figures simply seeking freedom. Others are nobles refusing to accept they are Witches, for to do so is to be disinherited. Yet others are terrified of what they may become, so run away. Whatever the case, few will admit what they are, as all risk burning by over-zealous Sigmarites.</p><p>Witches lead dangerous lives. Though some pose as Magisters, such deceptions are easily discerned by anyone with any knowledge of magic. Nevertheless, bands of adventurers — especially those without unwavering faith or moral qualms — rarely care for the specifics of a Witch’s education so long as the methods used are effective and have no truck with the Dark Gods. Although unsanctioned witchery is illegal — carrying the death penalty — most Magisters have a brief experience as a Witch before entering the Colleges of Magic. This is acknowledged by both the Colleges and the cults, so a Witch, if discovered, should submit to the authorities. Training in the Colleges could be covered as time between adventures, meaning the Witch can return at a later date in the Wizard career, or it could become the focus of a new adventure.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/witch.webp\"

Many larger settlements host competitions to celebrate the fastest, with the winners taking prizes and lucrative job contracts. Messengers can also be found working for the military, noble houses, large merchant houses, and for criminal gangs seeking to maintain their privacy.</p><p>Messages can contain all sorts of information, and some lead to adventure should they be intercepted. The easiest way for any villain (or innocent party) to get hold of such information will be to waylay a Messenger. If this happens, it will be the Messenger’s duty to follow things through until the message is recovered. As Messengers are usually freelance, paid per package delivered, it is simple enough to drop everything then pick-up work when they return.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image

Unlike the inland villages, those on the great rivers frequently receive outsiders who trade and restock, meaning Riverwomen are somewhat more open and diverse, and often the first with news from distant lands. There are any number of diverse jobs supported by the river. Many harvest the Reik’s bounty: fisherfolk (using rod, spear, or net), eelers (using traps or pots), or diggers for shellfish. Many live in riverside villages laboring, dredging, or lugging, and maintaining the Reik’s many thousands of vessels.</p><p> </p><p>A Riverwoman will feel at home on any stretch of water, and their skills ensure they can drop everything, confident that they will be able to find work elsewhere should they need to. A Riverwoman is well-placed to get the lowdown on the more iniquitous side of river life and may have contacts among the river’s lowlifes. With their knowledge and experience they can make all the difference to a water-based expedition or investigation.</p><p style=\"margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt\"><span

Slayers will occasionally take other odd jobs, for drinking money or to finance their travels, but will seek death along the way.

The Empire’s larger towns and cities have guilds to protect local Artisans from fraudsters, as an Artisan’s entire livelihood can be jeopardized by unskilled competitors hawking cheap low-quality merchandise. Guild Artisans observe strict quality standards, with those failing to meet them blackballed and forbidden to trade locally.</p><p> Artisans work at all levels of society not just producing goods, but also repairing them. They are employed by navies to maintain vessels, by armies to manage war machines and siegeworks, and by merchant houses of all sizes to transform raw materials into sellable goods.</p><p> Artisans in training can be sent to practice under other masters. The constant pressure to achieve perfection is so stiﬂing that young Artisans sometimes take a break to pursue more liberating enterprises, sometimes supporting the army or navy.</p><p> Dwarf Guilds don’t usually admit Humans, and Dwarfs are traditionally allowed to practice their trade in Imperial cities without joining a local Guild. Tis can cause conﬂict as the Guilds are rarely pleased with skilled competition. Halﬂings are not so particular, and most will happily join Human Guilds (if admitted) and allow Humans to join their Guilds. Elves do not have Artisan’s Guilds, and though they could join one it is unlikely they would lower themselves to do so. </p><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Nobles often inherit vast wealth and holdings, although only those with a direct line of succession can expect to wield any genuine power. Many spend their lives consolidating this wealth and power through business, politics, and conquest. Those without substantial inheritance must make their own way in the world, joining the State Army or navy as a commissioned officer, or commit to service of one of the gods. It is common to find Nobles working for more powerful noble houses, such as sending their daughters to serve as hand maidens to royalty.</p><p> Many Nobles serve their families abroad in the hopes they can advance their station and earn acclaim amongst their peers. Others, bored by pampered living, search for excitement as adventurers and would-be heroes. Scions with few prospects sometimes seek their fortunes far from courtly intrigue and betrayal, taking up other occupations to expand their options.</p><p>The GM should consider carefully whether to allow players to choose the Noble career. It comes with a lot of trappings and temporal power, especially at the higher levels of the career.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

On major trade-routes, the patrols have larger vessels manned by ‘Shipswords’ trained to tackle larger threats like Greenskins or Trolls.</p><p>Some Riverwardens rarely see the water, instead manning remote outposts overlooking strategically important waters. Others crew fast riverboats charged to intercept smugglers in the night. The largest Riverwarden vessels are effectively sea-worthy warships, bristling with cannon and mortars, ready for almost any eventuality</p><p>A diligent Riverwarden, searching vessels and following up leads, might stumble across any sort of nefarious plot or sinister cargo. Riverwardens typically work month-long shifts, but this means they also have months off. Tis structure is ideal for adventuring: as a Riverwarden need not desert their post to pursue private matters, or even have to persuade their Sergeant that it is their duty to follow up crimes. They can head off, investigate, and be back long before their next cycle begins.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

For the ambitious, rare exotic goods such as Dwarf gromril or Eastern spices command higher profits, but risk longer transport routes and require strong foreign contacts. Merchants cannot sell in most towns without approval from (and payments to) a Merchants’ Guild, powerful institutions rivalling the noble courts’ political inﬂuence. Local commerce is managed by Traders who ship goods between backwater villages and nearby towns.</p><p>Traders can join guilds by apprenticing under Master Merchants as junior business partners. Powerful Merchant Princes owning warehouses and sales offices in multiple cities enjoy the same status as minor nobles. In addition to trading, some Merchants also branch out into banking, moneylending, and investing.</p><p>Merchants share a certain kinship with adventurers, often hiring them over professional caravan guards. Adventurers are adaptable and enterprising by nature, making them ideal candidates for partnership in a trading company, bringing Merchants into contact with all manner of colorful

Some Apothecaries supplement their income selling illicit substances — from stimulants for desperate students, to hallucinogenic weirdroot for bored nobles or shady commissions from even shadier groups.

Not in pain.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Sabine Schmidt, Fishmonger</em></p><p>‘Listen, there is nothing to fear. Hexensnacht comes every year. We need only call on the Lord of Death to watch over us. So, come the midnight hour, we cry MORR! MORR! MORR!’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Father Wilhelm Abgott, Priest of Morr</em></p></div></div></blockquote><p> </p><div><div><div><p><em>You carry the word of your god, tending to the spiritual needs of the masses.</em></p><p>Priests tend to congregations of the faithful throughout the Old World. While many are assigned to a specific temple, others choose a wandering life to reach worshippers who cannot, or will not, attend temple. They are expected to exemplify the beliefs of their religion — which vary greatly depending on which deity they serve. High Priests are responsible for a temple and all its Cult and lay members. Alongside Lectors, they will often be called upon to advise the ruling classes, with many active in local politics. Priests have many duties connected to their God, such as Priests of Manann’s responsibility to consecrate new ships, or a Shallyan’s duty to tend to the sick and wounded, so they touch on most aspects of life in the Empire. For more on religion and the different Orders, see Chapter 7: Religion and Belief.</p><p>Some temple-bound Priests seek distractions to justify sojourns away. Disturbing matters heard from their congregations can send them on a quest for answers. Some High Priests find their administrative duties so far removed from the life they envisaged when they joined the Cult that they take extended pilgrimages away from their temple.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/priest.webp\"

Cult lawyers learn from their venerable peers, with those trained by the Cults of Verena and Sigmar especially well-regarded. Some Lawyers are hired as mediators, settling informal disputes outside costly courts, a practice favored by Halﬂings. Others work for criminal gangs, exploiting legal loopholes to free their always-guilty clients. At the top end of society, Barristers are the only lawyers allowed to address higher appeal courts in the city-states, charging exorbitant prices for their services.</p><p>Lawyers excel at getting people out of trouble, while adventurers excel at getting into it.

By preying on emotions and psychological weaknesses, Charlatans offer their ‘mark’ a prize that is too good to be true. Social privilege provides no protection, and even the loftiest citizens can fall victim to a skilled Charlatan. In addition to a knack for lying, a lack of conscience is also of benefit to Charlatans.</p><p> Charlatans include Swindlers, Con Artists, Gamblers, and other Scoundrels seeking to prey on the gullible. Halﬂings often operate distraction cons in small family groups. Young High Elves, slumming it with Humans, treat their cons as one big game, not motivated by profit, but to prove their superiority. Some experienced Charlatans work with artists, who forge documentation for a cut of any profits.</p><p> To avoid rousing suspicion, Charlatans rarely stay in one area for long. Few Swindlers openly admit to their calling, preferring instead to masquerade as anyone other than themselves. Because of this, there is little stopping Charlatans from pursuing side-matters of interests; equally, afterwards, they can return to grafting anywhere with rich fools willing to part with coin on naught but a promise.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/charlatan.webp\" /></div><p><strong>Species: </strong>Human,

Away from the battlefield, Warrior Priests are also expected to administer to soldiers’ spiritual wellbeing, as well as making sure morale stays high and discipline is ordered.

Wandering caravans of Strigany are a common sight in Reikland, and locals scrape together coin to hear their fortune, and buy charms and love potions. Most Mystics are perceptive and intuitive, able to divine their customers’ hopes and fears and give readings just specific enough to be believable. Mystics must be careful, and walk a fine line between accusations of trickery and heretical witchery. Mystics demonstrate their talent in a wide variety of ways: palmists and card readers are common amongst the Strigany, while a Wood Elf is more likely to interpret the signs and symbols to be found around them in nature, or to be inspired by dreams and visions. Many cults also have their own Seers and Sages, each prophesizing the future through the paradigm of their beliefs.</p><p>Mystics might seek a life of adventure if their insights draw the attention of priests and witch hunters. Dreams and visions also provide an incentive to join a band of adventurers: perhaps the Mystic foresees a terrible future ahead if action is not taken? No matter their motivation, once on the road, Mystics can easily ply their trade wherever they should travel.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Most Herbalists’ lore is verbally passed down from master to apprentice, so names for illnesses and treatments often vary from village to village. The most experienced Herbwises are sent for in cases of mysterious or stubborn sicknesses. Herbalists dedicate time to visiting the sick, diagnosing their ailments and searching for herbs to treat them with. Some Herbalists ply a darker trade, sought out by those who can pay a high price for the illicit substances they offer. Although an untrue stereotype, it’s a standing joke in the trade that Halﬂing Herbalists are only interest in pipeweed and wyrdroot.</p><p>With knowledge of poultices and potions, Herbalists can easily find a place with a band of travelers or mercenaries. When particularly virulent diseases take hold, Herbwises often send their apprentices to far off places in search of rarer herbs, and some find themselves in all manner of unexpected trouble. The Wood Elves’ knowledge of plants and herbs is legendary. In the Grey Mountains it is said that The Goddess Shallya wandered Athel Loren to learn their lore when Ranald was dying of an affiction she could not cure. High Elves who study the art of herbalism follow Lileath the Maiden’s teachings, and it’s rumored there is an ancient elven library in Marienburg which records the medicinal use of every plant in the Old World, although no Human has yet been granted access.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/herbalist.webp\"

While the healing arts are ancient, many deriving from Elven practices, the formal science of medicine is relatively new and not-entirely-trusted. Due to the Empire’s history with necromancy and the safe-guards imposed by the Cult of Morr, studying cadavers is forbidden, making learning of anatomy hard. Medicine’s reputation suffered further from swindlers selling ‘miracle cure-alls’ that do nothing or cause actual harm. Physicians learn their profession at a university or while apprenticed to a Guild Physician. Most cheap surgery is undertaken by back-street physicians known as barber-surgeons whose training is informal. Trained doctors with strong stomachs are in demand for the State Armies. The most famed Physicians almost exclusively tend to wealthy merchants and the nobility.</p><p>Physician’s Guild fees are notoriously expensive, which can cause newer Physicians without steady clientele to seek alternate sources of income. Some Physicians consistently search for more effective treatments and new medicines, which can take them far afield. Others like to expand their knowledge of anatomy by studying grievous wounds first hand, and there are few better ways to do that than by travelling with adventurers.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div

For some Duelists the act of fighting is reward enough for the considerable risks they face. Training is dangerous, leaving some apprentices crippled or scarred for life. Those who live long enough to learn from their mistakes can aspire to the fame of a Blademaster, teaching their techniques to eager students. Judicial Champions duel on behalf of governments and nobles, and their blades can determine the fates of nations. Some modern Duelists, especially hot-headed Altdorf students, favor pistols. Tis is regarded by the older generation as dishonorable and fool-hardy.</p><p>Both inexperienced and esteemed Duelists alike travel the Empire in search of opponents with which to bolster their reputations. For others, the hunt for a veteran instructor drives them to explore the furthest ﬂung of the Old World’s locales. Masters of foreign techniques are also sought by Duelists who wish to add unique styles of fighting to their repertoires. As skilled combatants, Duelists often augment their livelihood with mercenary work, even acting as guards for caravans and riverboats in a pinch. Although Dwarfs have no interest in fencing with ﬂimsy swords and the frippery of the dueling scene, they have long traditions of using combat to resolve bitter disputes, and will travel far to enhance their skills.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/duellist.webp\" /></div><p><strong>Species: </strong>Human, Dwarf,

From the lowliest footpad to the wiliest burglar, the thought of an honest day’s work in return for a respectable wage is little more than a bad joke. Thieves often organize themselves into gangs alongside charlatans, racketeers, and fences to further their mutual wealth. Bitter feuds between such illicit organizations have been known to last for years or even decades. The lowliest Thieves target individuals, picking pockets or waylaying victims in rat-infested alleyways. Burglars avoid confrontation breaking into businesses and residences, carrying off portable valuables. More ambitious thieves scope out their targets for days or weeks, even going so far as to infiltrate their target locations to get a more precise lay of the land. Working with other professional burglars, such experts can organize heists of which their lesser peers can only dream.</p><p>Thieves who run afoul of the law are obliged to hide or ﬂee from justice, putting many would-be inmates on the run. Sometimes the very items stolen by Thieves are of such exorbitant value or supernatural quality they seem to attract trouble like a moldering corpse draws ﬂies, which can lead them into all sorts of unexpected adventures. Of course, a Burglar’s talents are always valuable to adventurers, and reliable examples can expect to be well-compensated for their skills.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image

Body Snatchers have been known to cut out the middle man and take beggars or other unfortunates straight off the streets. Tomb Robbers avoid the legal dangers of looting the recently dead, and instead journey to ancient ruins and barrows, risking the restless dead and brigands alike.

It’s even rumored that the great wealth of one of the Knightly Orders came from a group of their members plundering a foreign tomb.</p><p>Grave Robbers easily take to the adventuring life, especially if their nocturnal sojourns are discovered by unsympathetic authorities. They may also be sought out by antiquarians who wish to engage their expert services in the excavation of a tomb, or perhaps they will feel compelled to track down a suspected necromancer who is using corpses for nefarious purposes.</p></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/grave-robber.webp\" /></div><p><strong>Species: </strong>Human,

Failure to improve — or, at the very least, maintain — an employer’s lands or provisions is often met with disfavor. In some instances, multiple wardens work together to keep their employer’s estate in correct order. A Warden’s oversight can cover a variety of duties: ensuring the upkeep of a grand estate, overseeing a lord’s hunting grounds, or caring for a rarely-visited holidaying home. Wardens might keep watch over forested or agricultural lands, or see to the maintenance of lakes, rivers, or ponds. Those in the employ of the richest and most powerful can rise to immensely powerful positions themselves.</p><p>Wardens rarely travel unless their duties call for it. That said, even those assigned to oversee an estate’s lands or hunting grounds must make regular patrols to assess the property’s condition and to discourage poachers. When between jobs, Wardens often find work as guides or hunters, and such activities can lead to much excitement or terror. Wardens with a grudge against former masters might even be inclined to provide enemies with confidential information regarding their old estates.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div

Most rise before the sun for morning prayer before toiling in fields, tending to the sick, or preserving important manuscripts. Vows of pilgrimage cause some to travel the Empire, while others take oaths to serve the community, moving amongst the people, tending to their spiritual needs. Devoted hermits and tenders to shrines are also thought of as ‘Nuns’ or ‘Monks’ by the folk of the Empire. Many Nuns learn valuable trades such as vintners, brewers or calligraphers. Abbesses use these activities to attract donations and patronage from the local nobility. Leaders of particularly large or martial Orders can gather significant inﬂuence both within their own cult and with the ruling classes of a province. For more on religion and the different Orders, see Chapter 7: Religion and Belief.</p><p>When a religious order discovers terrible secrets or fragments of prophecy, its leaders may feel they must act, sending brothers and sisters abroad. Abbeys along pilgrimage routes will often also send their members abroad to guard the many pilgrims traversing the lengthy holy roads across the Empire.

Most are legally appointed by provincial courts and receive warrant papers granting license to seize or sometimes kill the target. While some are motivated by Verena’s justice, most are more concerned by the rewards, often finding the ‘dead’ in ‘dead or alive’ to be the most convenient route to their fortune. Many Bounty Hunters start as Thief-Takers, those hired by crime victims to retrieve stolen goods. Over time, those with an established reputation may find permanent work from a merchant or noble house, guild, or cult, or may build a company of Bounty Hunters, working as a group to collect the largest rewards.</p><p>In their pursuit of wanted criminals, Bounty Hunters often stumble into unplanned adventures. As independent operatives, Bounty Hunters are perfectly suited to dropping their day job to pursue whatever business is afoot. Further, given their broad base of skills are always in demand, it is not uncommon to see Bounty Hunters turning their hand to adventuring full-time, hiring their skills out in return for payments. Bounty Hunters are a perfect starting career as they present a solid mixture of social and combat skills allowing you to contribute no matter the circumstances</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div

Villagers make up most of the Empire’s population and perform a variety of valuable roles, including Farmers, Charcoal Burners, Woodsmen, Millers, Herders, and many more. Most villages fall under the domain of a noble family, where the day-to-day administration of the estate is overseen by a bailiff. Village affairs are usually managed by a village council of local tradesmen and farmers led by an Elder. A village Councilor or Elder can hold significant local inﬂuence overseeing many decisions concerning the surrounding land.</p><p>The pastoral safety of a sheltered village is an unspeakable bore for some young Villagers who listen avidly to the tales of faraway lands. Of course, the stories they hear from wandering Pedlars and Strigany, all fueling schemes to escape, bear little relation to the harsh reality of Empire life. During winter, when food is short, and the fields do not need tending, young folk venturing to nearby towns and cities for work often never return, soon caught in the net of civilization’s excitement and adventure.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/villager.webp\" /></div><p><strong>Species: </strong>Human, Dwarf,

Mining company engineers are well-paid; less so the State Army Engineers who maintain the Imperial war machines and act as sappers and bridge-builders. Master Engineers often find themselves leading teams on ambitious construction projects. Chartered Engineers are the most trusted in the Empire, called upon to design, test, and build such prestigious Imperial Commissions like the complex Steam Wheel Locks, which have revolutionized the speed of travel in the canals of the Vorbergland.</p><p>Some Engineers are drawn to investigate ancient Dwarf Holds, most now abandoned, for entombed within are the secrets of the master builders of old. Those who dare their depths may find millennia-old marvels, many of which are repurposed by Goblins and Skaven for their own nefarious purposes. Equally enticing are the stone sky bridges soaring above the Holds, some stretching for many miles, true wonders of bygone engineering that once connected thriving Dwarf settlements, forts, and

Poorer Scholars act as scribes, reading and writing notes for others as most of the Empire’s citizens are illiterate. Others become tutors educating the wealthy.</p><p>The most gifted Masters are invited to join a university, with renowned Professors delivering popular lectures to hundreds of Students. Dwarves and High Elves are less likely to be employed in an Imperial institution, though they may tour the Empire in search of esoteric knowledge.</p><p>Poor Scholars who cannot or will not tutor often need funds to continue their research. A few search the dark corners of the world for lost secrets and ancient tomes. Others are hired to accompany adventuring expeditions where their knowledge can be put to more practical use.</p><p>Scholar is a useful Career, with access to rare Lore skills, a good way for the GM to share information with players. Played with commonsense they can counter-balance rash and martially-inclined characters’ tendencies to solve every problem with a blade.

If caught, Spies are rarely executed quickly and often tortured at length. Many Informers are forced into spying via blackmail or other threats.

Tis can provide opportunities for adventures around the Empire. Bored heirs, closeted by over-protective parents, might treat their young Servants more like friends, providing them with encouragement and funds to seek out adventures, living vicariously through them when they report back with tales of derring-do. Favored Servants are, on occasion, entrusted with duties that take them beyond their familiar surroundings, or even loaned to other family members or peers.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div

Should they have something they wish to personally pursue, they will require permission from senior officers, perhaps buy out their commission if they have one, or go absent without leave.

Soldiers are the mainstay of these armies, trained to fight as part of a larger group with individual skill supplemented by strength in numbers. Rarely encouraged to think for themselves, Soldiers are famous for their stoic fatalism as they are ordered from pillar to post in the service of their betters. Soldiers could be archers, crossbowmen, halberdiers, handgunners, swordsmen, or spearmen, and that’s just in a typical State regiment. Dwarfs employ soldiers like Hammerers and Thunderers, while Elven rank and file are usually archers and spearmen. There are many other Soldiers, such as Mercenaries, local Militias (which are rarely better than Recruits), private armies, cult forces, and more</p><p>Soldiers have little free time, but they still have adventuring opportunities. Outside campaigning season, many receive extended periods of leave. Officers of the State Armies can also command small bands of Soldiers to investigate unusual happenings in their regiment’s ‘territory’ and some officers view this kind of adventuring as excellent training to keep their Soldiers sharp. Non-human Soldiers will often be on missions in the Empire that are adventures by their very nature.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Rather, they are considered artisans of great skill and are well-respected amongst the Dawi. Possessed of a keen sense for stone, Dwarfs are drawn to valuable seams and seemingly have a sixth-sense for when to shore up passages. Some Dwarf clans hold such pride in their mining ability that they march to war armed with picks rather than axes.</p></div></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Successful Fences sometimes operate as pawn brokers, importers, or other merchants. Others prefer to remain mobile, trafficking only in portable items. Though the average Fence deals in goods and valuables, there are also well-informed specialists who focus on information and forbidden knowledge. Some Fences move stolen items across the Empire. A painting stolen in Altdorf is easier to sell in Talabheim to an audience unaware of the theft. When high profile items vanish, Fences are also the first individuals to be consulted by those looking to acquire them. Some Fences even take commissions from clients, connecting them with those who can steal to order.</p><p>The search for buyers and sellers, or the need to escape a terrible situation, can take a Fence anywhere. They can be found across the Empire and in many regions beyond its borders. Up-and-coming Brokers transport illicit goods between Old World cities in search of buyers. Others, looking to make a name for themselves elsewhere, attempt to make their own niches in existing city underworlds. Given that their interests often collide, Fences and merchants make occasional bedfellows, as well.

To legally cast magic in the Empire, a Human must follow the Articles of Imperial Magic and belong to one of the Eight Colleges of Magic in Altdorf — each dedicated to a specific wind, as Magisters can only safely channel one. After graduation, Apprentices become Magisters and serve the Empire. Magisters carefully study and practice their art, which, according to the Articles, they can only use outside their colleges in defense of their own life, or against the enemies of the Empire. Many Magisters are attached to the Empire State Army, and although they are treated with cautious suspicion, none can deny their effectiveness on the battlefield.</p><p>Many Magisters leave the Colleges of Magic in debt for the cost of their tuition. These Wizards may be keen to find immediate employment, or seek out their fortune on land, at sea, or anywhere else they might be able to find relics, artefacts or lost tomes of magical lore. Journeying Magisters, eager to prove themselves, are actively encouraged to test their skills across the Empire by hunting down whatever dangers threaten the local populace.</p><p>Wizards are excellent characters to add some firepower to a group, but it can be intimidating for new players to have to learn a whole additional set of rules for spells. Because of this the GM should be aware that they might initially need some extra support to ensure that they are using these rules effectively and to the group’s best advantage. You’ll choose the color of magic you study when you take the Arcane Magic Talent.

Killed six of us…’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Valentin Behr, Roadwarden</em></p><p> ‘...and he says, “Titus, why d’you carry them shears?” And I says, “These?” And he says, “Aye, those’re the only shears I see.” So I laughed and answered: “Sometimes they don’t want to take off their rings like I ask ‘em to. When I show ‘em the shears, most of ‘em change their tune right quick. And if they don’t…’’. Hehehe.’ </p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Hasslich Widmann, Outlaw</em></p></div></div></div></blockquote><p><em>You prey upon travelers, extracting a toll from the vulnerable and the unsuspecting.</em></p><p>Outlaws ply the roads of the Old World in search of vulnerable travelers and merchant caravans. They lead dangerous and often hardscrabble lives. Many do not see themselves as criminals, but as oppressed groups trying to live their lives free from outside constraints. Many Wood Elf outlaws ft this description, pushing back against the Humans proliferating at the edge of the forests, willing to take more drastic action than others of their kind. Particularly savvy and brutal Outlaws may form bands of their own, sometimes even uniting several bands under a single banner. Such Bandit Kings are feared and reviled by noble and peasant alike. Tough few Outlaws discriminate in choosing their prey, some claim to protect the common man. These do-gooders focus their larceny on greedy nobles and, in return, locals may provide them with food, information, and safe harbor.</p><p>Outlaw bands are not all wild mobs, so many can be reasoned with if approached correctly. An Outlaw might be asked to accompany a group of adventurers as a guide or to protect them, especially if the group are trying to stop unholy activity in a Bandit King’s domain. Individual Outlaws may find it simple to join an adventuring band, although they may need to disguise themselves if they go anywhere the Outlaw is wanted.</p><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image

A Protagonist could be the brute in the local bar everyone knows will bully for coin, or with the reputation for unﬂinching violence.

A massed charge is an awesome sight, but even alone a Knight can stand as a one-person army. There are many Knightly Orders in the Empire, the most famous including the Reiksguard, the White Wolves, the Knights Panther, and the Knights Griffon, each of which have their own gloried history and mighty heroes. Most Empire Knights belong to secular knightly orders, partly because training heavy lancers is too prohibitively expensive for most nobles. The templar orders, those dedicated to the service of a single deity are just as common but are somewhat more independent. Alongside these are an uncounted number of free-lances, mercenary knights, and disgraced knights, most of whom sell their lance to the highest bidder.</p><p>Knights might be asked to venture out to fulfill a duty on behalf of their Order or be sought out by nobles and employed to accompany a restless heir around the Empire. Similarly, templars will have responsibility to do their god’s will. All of these provide perfect opportunities for Knights looking to adventure. By comparison, a free-lance is just that, and a life of adventure is what they follow by default.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Once Hedge Witches were respected members of rural communities, practicing magics older than the forests. But decades of persecution since the founding of the Colleges of Magic have left the few surviving Hedge Witches disparate and broken. They hide in the quietest corners of the Old World, their smoky huts and creaking hovels standing astride the boundary between civilization and the trackless wilds. Most Hedge Witches are solitary to protect themselves from prying strangers, but their talents are often known to locals. Their knowledge of warding evil is usually secret, but their herbalism, midwifery, and healing arts are quickly sought in times of need</p><p>A Hedge Witch is often the first to notice supernatural foul play. The subsequent investigations often lead to all sorts of dangers and adventure. When Witch Hunters come to town, Hedge Witches often take a leave of absence, lying low or travelling elsewhere until danger is passed.</p><p>The Hedgefolk are known by many names across the Empire, but have one thing in common: the goal of preserving their ancient traditions from destruction. Hedge Witches have little love for the Colleges of Magic, knowing any child taken by them will likely never return to serve their community, instead pressed into service in some far-off war. Whenever possible they hide children they consider ‘blessed’ from passing magisters, although occasionally one will be sent to the Colleges — as a sacrifice or a spy, who can say?</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/hedge-witch.webp\"

The best can command high wages and are entrusted with the lives of the Empire’s finest personages and most valuable items. Guards are everywhere from the Imperial palace, down to bouncers who might stand outside a tavern all night and throw drunks into the street. Grave wardens fending off grave robbers from Morr’s Gardens. Temple guards defend temples and important priests. Merchants often require guards locally, for valuable cargo stored in a warehouse or in transit. Some claim personal bodyguards have the most interesting guarding jobs because they must stay with their esteemed employers, and they get to see important lives going on first hand.</p><p>Guards can find adventure when their guardianship is compromised. Any guard worth his salt would wish to follow up and investigate those who have thwarted them, and get whatever they were guarding back to its true owner. This could easily turn into an exciting adventure. Many of those going on expeditions will require guards to accompany them, to adventure, profit or an untimely demise.</p></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

They fill various roles for private artisans or municipal councils: Bankers, Clerks, Hawkers, Innkeepers, Newspaper Vendors, Ostlers, Shopkeepers, Toll-keepers, Washers, and many more. Pay rates vary; some can haggle for extra commission, whereas civil employees such as lamplighters and toll-keepers are paid fixed salaries. There is little opportunity for promotion, but those with determination, savvy, and luck might eventually own property or a business.</p><p>The most successful Townsmen often join local councils overseeing civic matters, with Burgomeisters — the most important municipal leaders — often enjoying the same social status as Merchant Princes and Guildmasters.</p><p>Townsmen are part of a growing class of citizen with both time and money at their disposal. Many take one or two days off a week and can easily ft in a life of adventure between shifts or after closing time. Some may wish to go even further afield, and if the Townsman has some money put aside, it should be simple to negotiate some time off with an employer. It’s very common for citizens of the Empire to go on pilgrimages for weeks or months at a time. Skilled workers are always in demand, and there will likely be a role waiting when they come home.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

If the ‘fees’ are not paid on time, the victims, their families, and their livelihoods are at considerable risk. Large gangs bribe or intimidate local authorities to ignore their activities — their Tugs are always willing to kill — or worse — to keep business running smoothly. Tugs are employed to collect debts of all kind, especially those incurred through gambling losses or high-interest-rate loans. In a world brimming with poverty, the promise of easy wealth is an allure countless fools are unable to ignore. The more organized the graft, the larger and more complex the organizations running them become. While the smallest rackets are run by small gangs with limited territory beyond a building or two, the largest can span cities or even entire provinces, and the Crime Lords who run them can wield extraordinary power.</p><p>Thugs and Racketeers are always willing to resort to threats and violence, making them valuable members of any party that expects to face aggressive opposition. Gang Bosses might even take their business on the road, looking to expand their territory or explore new opportunities for intrigue and profit. Given the competitive nature of such rackets, even the most powerful Crime Lords might find themselves deposed by opponents or treachery. Forced to hide or ﬂee, such experienced crooks can seek to use a group of experienced adventurers to their advantage.</p></div></div></div><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Strider","text":{"content":"<blockquote><p>‘A herd of Beastmen had been spotted out by Drakenhohle, so we drew the bent horseshoe and had to go looking for them. Picking up their trail was easy, they trampled everything and stank like an Orc latrine besides. Found the whole herd dead in their camp, an arrow in each heart. Now, me and the lads, we’ve tangled with forest elves a few times. They all make their own kit, and the fletching on their arrows can be like a signature. Every feather was the same, meaning the herd was taken down by one archer. The lads and I, we buried the bodies and scattered some seeds on top, and left VERY carefully.”</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"> -Gunther Rosch, state soldier’</p></blockquote><p>The forests are ancient and deadly, a haven for bandits and dangerous outcasts. They teem with natural predators such as bears, wolves and giant spiders. If, somehow, these threats weren’t enough to hurry a traveller on their way, there is no shortage of wholly unnatural creatures either, such as foul trolls, Beastman herds, or the walking dead. But perhaps the deadliest threat of all is the Ghost Strider. Even the city-born High Elves respect the beauty of nature, and Wood Elves are renowned for the ferocity with which they defend their lands. The Ghost Strider epitomises this defence. Master archers, they hunt all threats to the natural world with a determination and skill that would be terrifying to behold, if not for their almost supernatural speed and silence. Ghost Striders are so attuned to the natural world that nature itself seems to hide their passage from prying eyes. Indeed, so devoted are they to their task that even other Wood Elves consider them intimidating, perhaps skirting closer to obsession than is healthy for an intensely emotional people. </p><p>To a Ghost Strider the forest is sacred above all else, and no transgression is beneath their punishment, whether beast of Chaos or a peasant cutting branches for firewood. While most commonly seen scouring the forests for their enemies, Ghost Striders are comfortable in any wilderness, and will protect an unspoiled, windswept mountain just as fiercely as a woodland glade (much to the ire of many a Dwarf miner). They tend to be solitary, even preferring the wilderness to the elf kingdoms they protect, but they are pragmatic and not above working with others. </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Go to Madame Zelda. She can often tell where lost objects are.

That cannot be natural, can it? It must be a form of witchcraft.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Received wisdom throughout the Old World</em></p><p>‘Haagen’s new office clerk is good. More than once he has warned his employer off from engaging in deals with con men. It’s as if he can smell a dishonest deal.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Overheard near the New Palace in Paleisbuurt</em></p></blockquote><p><em>You possess the rare ability to infer facts about the past through contact with a person, item, or place.</em></p><p>A scarce few Humans possess an ability to look back into the past, to see what happened in a specific location, with a certain object, or to a certain person they touch. Even fewer people can use that ability without being driven out of their wits. Those people who use this rare ability regularly are known as scryers.</p><h3>A Rare Breed</h3><p>Scrying is a rare talent. This rarity makes it difficult to describe a typical scryer, because each of these individuals, and each of these talents, are unique. Some scryers can read the thoughts of people they touch, others can find out an object’s history, others again touch an object and catch a glimpse of that object’s previous owners.</p><p>Some scryers use tools, such as cards or crystals, to help them get their visions. Others take herbal preparations, bulbs of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.trappings.b6tGqvNe1jYBdeN5]{Weirdroot}, or perform personal rituals to get into a state of mind that is sensitive to visions. Others turn to alcohol after scrying, to dull their senses and forget what they have seen.</p><p>Scryers are sought after by nobles, who employ them as a source of information, a way to read the intentions of their political rivals, or as a status symbol. Other scryers live in cities or villages, offering their services to whoever wants to pay for them. This can be dangerous, however, for the public may get the idea that the scryer is practising a kind of witchcraft. Scryers can easily create mistrust if they are not careful. They must be truthful, but also diplomatic.</p><h3>Charlatans and Imposters</h3><p>Pretending to be a scryer can be an easy way to earn a living, as some charlatans have found. These imposters are often more attuned to their clients’ needs than actual scryers, and less encumbered by visions of the truth.</p><p>This allows them to say what their clients want to hear, and to pretend to have insights actual scryers don’t have, such as the power to see into the future, or to reach the spirits of those interred at the local Garden of Morr. This client-focused approach often makes the public appreciate these charlatans more than authentic scryers, who often tell truths that their clients don’t wish to hear.</p><div class=\"journal-image

They can prepare chemical concoctions and often work together with metalworkers. Theirs is a specialised kind of knowledge, and one that is in high demand. The Artillery School in Nuln, for example, keeps a whole department of alchemists tasked with the creation of blackpowder, and improving its efficiency.</p><p>Other alchemists in the same faculty work to find an alloy that makes for better barrels for cannons and blunderbusses. In civilian life, alchemists invent, improve, and produce products like dyes and pigments, medicines, pesticides, or soap. This can be a lucrative business and, next to inventing new concoctions, they have become quite adept at convincing people to buy these products for outrageous prices.</p><h3>For Love of Smoke and Powder</h3><p>Not all alchemists have such a practical bent. Some consider these worldly concerns unworthy of their attention. Their sole interest is in acquiring knowledge. Transmuting metal is a popular subject of research among these alchemists, with the transmutation of lead into gold being the ultimate goal. However, to date, nobody has managed to succeed in this — not permanently, at least.</p><p>But whether they choose a worldly path or an academic one, alchemists need a laboratory to conduct experiments or to prepare materials. They spend much of their time there, many even live at their workplace. An alchemist’s laboratory will have containers for all sorts of different ingredients, a pestle and mortar, a furnace, cauldrons to melt stuff and purify metal, and glass bottles and bowls to mix ingredients in.</p><h3>Alchemy and True Magic</h3><p>The art of alchemy has inextricable links to <em>Chamon</em>, the wind of transmutation and experimentation. Some master alchemists develop a sense for this wind — they can see its golden glow around their experiments. Some even claim to be able to read the wind, to predict the success or failure of their experiment by the way that the wind behaves.</p><p>This is why the @UUID[JournalEntry.kLTWtoz5d7Yt2zAJ.JournalEntryPage.RmCQLDxu6VgCFRdI#the-gold-college]{Gold College} maintains good relationships with, and even supports, alchemical institutions in the Empire. Many wizard apprentices in the Gold College are recruited from alchemical schools.</p><p>But not all alchemists who develop @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f.JournalEntryPage.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#second-sight]{the Sight} join the Golden Order. Some of them don’t recognise the magic wind for what it is, and treat it as just another ingredient or accelerant, without acknowledging its danger — often they don’t even realise that this ingredient they are working with is raw magic.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/actors/mundane-alchemist.webp\" width=\"305\" height=\"378\"

Each college sponsors a small cadre of Magisters Vigilant, though the Grey College is said to sponsor several of their members to take on the role during their careers.</p><h3>An Old Tradition</h3><p>The traditions that uphold the role of Magister Vigilant date back to the Wizards’ War of 1976 IC and are therefore older than the colleges themselves. At that time, the wizards of Middenheim realised that if they were going to continue to be tolerated in the city, they had better adopt the habit of hunting down and destroying rogue magic users, otherwise the people might demand that Sigmarite witch hunters be allowed to do the job for them.</p><p>Unlike other wizards, Magisters Vigiliant are not expected to take on apprentices or display the panoply of a wizard. They combine the skills of spy, investigator, witch hunter, and wizard. The degree to which they are honoured has less to do with the spells they can master and pass on, but how good they are at tracking down and killing witches, necromancers, and Chaos sorcerers.</p><p>Magisters Vigilant report to the head of the college, who often is the only person who knows their secret role. And even though they confer with their superior, a Magister Vigilant is often judge, jury, and executioner in one.</p><p>Those wizards who have erred don’t often appear before a formal court — the colleges prefer to keep their dirty laundry hidden.</p><h3>Sibling Rivalry</h3><p>No love is lost between Magisters Vigilant and witch hunters as they don’t see each other as working for the same cause. Magisters Vigilant are preoccupied with upholding the reputation of their orders and try to leave few traces of their work. Witch hunters, on the other hand, usually wish to demonstrate how dangerous magic is and like to make a show of catching rogue wizards and prosecuting them.</p><div class=\"journal-image

They prefer researching old volumes for obscure facts and theories or conducting experiments and furthering science over the day-to-day running of the organisation they are part of.</p><p>That is why these organisations require a staff of a more practical bent; beadles, who guard the college halls, libraries, and laboratories from burglars, spies, and — most of all — misbehaving students.</p><h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3><p>Beadles are responsible for ensuring that the academics of the institution are fully supported, so that they can devote themselves to their work. Beadles and their staff take care of the maintenance of the building and its premises, keep supplies of materials well stocked, maintain relations with the authorities, organise the rituals and customs of their college, and do everything else to keep the institution running.</p><p>How much work this is depends very much on the college a beadle serves. The Faculty of Medicine at the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.OiAVm63T9JEFsVfR]{University of Altdorf}, which has dozens of professors and hundreds of students, needs a lot more support than the ramshackle and almost deserted college building of the Grey Order, whose members typically prefer travelling across the Empire rather than being stuck in Altdorf.</p><h3>Beadles of Note</h3><p>August Denkmit is the scarecrow-like beadle of that latter college, and the only staff he has are Max, a twelve-year old orphan with spindly legs, and his dog Rufus, a Nordland Terrier who excels at catching rats and chasing cats. All the hard work befalls upon Denkmit himself.</p><p>In contrast, the beadle of the Faculty of Military History at the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.OiAVm63T9JEFsVfR]{University of Altdorf}, the highly formal and punctual Ursula von Klopff, oversees a staff of almost sixty clerks, not including the porters who act as watchmen at the university grounds, and she still complains (usually with scores of figures to support her claim) that she is chronically understaffed. But then, she must deal with many demanding and annoying students, as well as with the consequences of the explosive demonstrations orchestrated by visiting members of the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.85UN6bKPTfGEBtBb.JournalEntryPage.HYkHeQZtD2AML3oG]{Imperial School of Engineers}.

Although I protested at first, you were right. The golems you created to assist us have had a significant effect on our workload.’</p><p>‘You can thank me later for that’,<em> Gelt said. </em>‘First, I’d like to hear your explanation for this invoice for new laboratory material. Surprisingly steep! Can you clarify that?’</p><p>‘Of course, sir. I’d like to start by reminding you that you suggested that the golems could be used in the laboratories, as they are more resistant to the materials used there than living staff. But they unfortunately also lack the precision needed to handle glassware and delicate instruments without damaging them. I had the golems clean the laboratories, and now several of the workshops need to be re-equipped.’</p><p><em>Gelt gave a metallic and disappointed groan that made Walther feel uncomfortable. </em>‘Another issue that has come to my attention as well. The students have apparently started a gambling ring.’</p><p><em>The beadle nodded. </em>‘That’s the case sir. You’re right. They have found a way to give the golems a series of elaborate instructions, and used that to start a golem fighting pit.’</p><p><em>Gelt inclined his head, the candlelight reflecting from his golden mask. </em>‘A fighting pit?’</p><p>‘That’s right, sir. In one of the unused basement forges. They let golems fight each other — they call it Construct Conflict. Each wizard equips and controls one golem. Members of the audience place bets on which one will win. At this moment, more than half of the golems are beyond repair.’</p><p><em>The patriarch leaned back in his chair.</em> ‘Perhaps this golem project was not such a good idea after all’<em>, he sighed. </em>‘I’ll have them deactivated — even though that means that they cannot assist your staff anymore.’</p><p>‘As you wish, sir.’ <em>Walther’s face was a study in morose composure, even though his tradtionalist’s heart leapt cartwheels for joy.</em></p><p style=\"text-align:right\">An extract from ‘<em>The Bothers of Beadledom</em>— <em>The Life and Death of Walther von Gaffen.’</em></p></blockquote>","format":1,"markdown":""},"_id":"5qc7HEs9akxw0hmR","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":1200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.nsZAkSDjPteDuC82.JournalEntryPage.5qc7HEs9akxw0hmR"}}},{"name":"Archer","text":{"content":"<blockquote><p> ‘Eight days it takes to train a handgunner, they say, eight days!

Anyone can hold a halberd or fire a handgun, they say, but it takes years of training to be an archer.</p><p>Though seen as a bit backwards by urban folk used to blackpowder and shining armour, the archer is more trusted in the countryside, and peasants see them as one of their own.</p><p>Archers are the lightest of foot troops, often used to scout and forage. They are better able to live off the land, which means they get the best food. They also have a reputation for being able to act on their own initiative, and able to find their way to the battle even through the most difficult terrain. An army in enemy territory relies on its archers far more than other troops might admit.</p><p>Archers take pride in their skills, and regularly hold competitions within companies and regiments, testing accuracy at a variety of distances. The finest archers are invited to represent their regiment in provincial championships.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">Non-Human Archers</h3><p>Human archers are never to be underestimated, but the non-Human ones are the most feared. The Halflings who fight under the name of Lumpin Croop’s Fighting Cocks are a group of mercenary scouts who command high prices, although they are thought lucky rather than highly competent and are as famed for their entertaining banter as for their skill with a bow.</p><p>The Elves of the forest are known for loose formations of archers who use the terrain to their advantage and whose success is down to individual accuracy rather than massed volleys. They are credited with such prodigious accomplishments of archery that reports of their deeds are hard to believe. They never turn up at Human tournaments, however, because they are never invited. Unlike their Wood Elf cousins, High Elves are famous for close ranks of archers, said to dim the sky with their massed arrows.</p><p>When not campaigning with their regiment, an archer will have plenty of opportunity to undertake adventure. Their skill with a bow will always be useful. The stealth of that weapon and its range gives any party an edge over their foes. Archers are also used to travelling light and living off the fruits of their marksmanship.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">The Deathjacks</h4><p>The Deathjacks are a regiment of elite archers from Stirland. Originally patrolling the area around the city of Wurtbad, their influence has grown to cover much of central Stirland.</p><p>More importantly, they are the scout regiment for the provincial army. As much as they have earned respect for their exploits on the field of battle, they have especially proved their worth in scouting and foraging.</p><p>They are without peer when making surreptitious raids on the enemy. They also have a reputation for raiding their own army’s supply train, if that is what it takes to keep them comfortably fed, although they might deny this as vicious rumour.</p><p> </p><div

the name of Sigmar, and his Empire, I swear to serve my captain, and my regiment, and I swear never to take a backward step in the face of any enemy or suffer dishonour, shame, and the disdain of my fellows.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Carroburg Greatsword Oath</em></p><p>‘The Greatswords are far too full of themselves. So what if they never take a backward step in the face of the enemy? It’s not like the rest of us spend all our time running away, is it? First thing they ever taught me in the Halberdiers was don’t run away. You don’t hear us shouting about it all the time.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Holger Kass, 1st Bögenhafen Halberdiers</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Skilfully wielding your vicious zweihänder, you are the greatest of all the Empire’s foot soldiers.</em></p><p>Greatswords are the signature elite infantry of the Imperial armies, the most prestigious and feared of all the Empire’s foot soldiers. They forsake the shield to wield huge zweihänder swords, ensuring their combats are short and deadly whichever way they go. Their large, two-handed weapons are unwieldy, so Greatswords need to be swift and athletic to compensate. For this reason, they dress in a much looser formation than other foot soldiers.</p><p> Together with their fame, Greatswords have accrued a reputation for arrogance and a disdain for other types of soldier. The Greatswords, of course, claim this reputation comes merely through the jealousy of their inferiors.</p><p>Because the zweihänder requires a completely different technique to a one-handed sword, there is much study and discussion of the correct way to fight with them. This debate seems to go on endlessly within the ranks. The issue has become a virtual science with many published treatises on the art. The old Estalian masters are considered to be the ultimate authority on the subject. Some Greatswords have been known to affect an Estalian accent when they feel the need to impress.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">Picked Troops</h3><p>Traditionally, members of the Greatswords are personally picked by noble lords from among the champions of the troops. To gain such promotion, a soldier must distinguish themself in the eyes of officers, or accomplish heroic feats. Greatsword regiments often garrison the castles of nobles or form their bodyguards on the battlefield. Such</p><p>troops swear oaths never to cede ground to the enemies of the Empire and to protect their lord at all costs. Greatsword veterans who abide by their oaths are often rewarded with knighthood.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">The Carroburg Greatswords</h4><p>The Carroburg Greatswords have a reputation for implacability and bravery going back to the great siege of Carroburg, when Reiklanders defended the city from Middenlander invaders. Their uniforms were so stained with the blood of friend and foe alike that they have worn deep red uniforms ever since. To this day, the Carroburg Greatswords consider that they fight for Sigmar himself and the regiment recruits very few devout Ulricans.</p><p>On entering the ranks, a recruit must swear an oath to Sigmar and to the Empire never to take a single backwards step in the face of the enemy. This oath is taken very seriously, and overly-literally. While other Greatswords have drills that involve backwards movement, the Carroburgers do not. This stubbornness on the battlefield seems to colour their attitude to many aspects of life.</p><p>A Greatsword might have trouble justifying their adventuring when they have made an oath to their regiment and they are a vital troop in the defence of the Empire. Perhaps they are on a mission to right a wrong. A matter of honour is exactly the sort of motivation they would take so seriously. Perhaps they have even become disillusioned with military service.</p><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-up-in-arms/assets/actors/greatsword.webp\" width=\"356\"

you prefer a spear or an axe?’</p><p>‘ Yes.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\">– <em>Old Halberdiers’ joke.</em></p><p>‘The greatest manoeuvre you can ever do with a Halberd, I learned from an old Tilean veteran. Watch carefully. Take the dough, add the sauce, some sliced sausage, a bit of cheese, then place the blade of your weapon in the fire, like so, for a few minutes until the crust is golden brown.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Holger Kass, 1st Bögenhafen Halberdiers</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Famously reliable, you are a stalwart of the infantry, and not to be trifled with.</em></p><p>The mainstay of all Imperial armies, Halberdiers are found in forces the length and breadth of the Empire, and beyond. They have a reputation for reliability and grit and make a formidable sight on the field of battle, massed closely together with their imposing weapons. The Halberdier takes heart from fighting in large groups of tightly formed units, where they benefit from the reach of the halberd while not suffering too much from a lack of manoeuvrability.</p><p>Though unwieldy and difficult to master, the halberd is a prodigious weapon in the hands of a trained halberdier. What it lacks in manoeuvrability it makes up for in reach and what it lacks in finesse it makes up for in sheer power. Though received wisdom has it that a Halberdier is not as effective a fighter in close order, Halberdiers have developed a method of fighting one-on-one and pride themselves on being a match for anyone armed with a sword and shield.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">The Death’s Heads</h4><p>The Ostermark Death’s Heads is the most famous Halberdier regiment in the Empire. It was founded around 500 years ago during the First Vampire Wars, formed from troops who came together to defend Essen against the forces of Vlad von Carstein. They wore black and red, and hid their faces behind death’s head masks to keep their identities secret. They distinguished themselves throughout the Vampire Wars and keep their excellent reputation to this day. They still wear death’s head masks when going into battle, striking fear into their enemies.</p><p>As with many soldiers, getting involved in adventure might seem to go against the thrust of their career, but a soldier’s life can afford some opportunities. The regiment might be stood down for the winter, or for an indefinite period of peace. The Halberdier might decide that the soldier’s life is not for them after all and be on the lookout for another career.</p><p>They might also be identified as a reliable and resourceful sort who could be sent on a special mission on behalf of the regiment, or one of its officers. Sometimes no one can go undercover as a hapless, common peasant quite as well as a hapless, common peasant.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">The Sons of the Reik</h4><p>Also known as Altdorf ’s Company of Honour, the Sons of the Reik are an elite unit and the city’s most famous. They have a reputation for being dashing on the field, but also somewhat belligerent on the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.XhWgwj2BstdmYY95]{Street of One Hundred Taverns}. Certainly, the company has a long and storied history and an impressive litany of battle honours.</p><p>The regiment supposedly recruits only the best and the bravest from the city’s other regiments. However, these days, there is some controversy surrounding its recruiting practices. It might be easier to buy one’s way in by greasing palms than by spilling blood.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">Von Kragsburg Guard</h4><p>Unusually, the Von Kragsburg Guard of Averheim is a regiment founded by nobility that functions as a mercenary company. This is very much frowned upon by other nobles, but ‘Dirty Duke’ von Kragsburg does very well out of it. Ultimately, the company is well trained and well run with a great reputation in the field. It has battle honours stretching all across the Empire and well beyond. Such a unit will always find paying customers.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/careers/soldier.webp\" width=\"474\" height=\"615\"

are unreliable, noisy, full of hot air, and they leave a foul smell behind them. And their guns aren’t much better.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Holger Kass, 1st Bögenhafen Halberdiers</em></p><p>‘We had some Nordlander archers on our left and the Altdorf Handgunners on our right as the Greenskins approached. I was fearing the worst, I don’t mind telling you. On the command, the archers loosed their arrows and the Handgunners fired. More Greenskins on the left fell, that’s for sure. But it was the ones on the right who ran.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Holger Kass, 1st Bögenhafen Halberdiers</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Wielding a handgun, you bring death to your enemies from long range — or at least put the fear of Sigmar into them.</em></p><p>The Handgunner is a comparative newcomer to the Imperial army. Though they have been around for hundreds of years, they are not yet entirely trusted by the rest of the military. Even so, as technology advances, they have become increasingly effective on the battlefield and are fielded in the Imperial armies in ever greater numbers.</p><p>Firing and maintaining a handgun is a complex and involved process. Handgunners tend to shroud their jobs in mystique and ritual, leaving the uninitiated to consider it almost like magic. The finer points of manufacture of weapons and blackpowder are heavily guarded secrets. To this day, many of the Empire’s simpler folk are frightened of blackpowder weapons. Some point to the fact that Handgunners need only a few weeks training before taking the field as testament to how simple their process actually is.</p><p>For many years the presence of Handgunners in the Empire’s armies, and those of the Dwarfs for that matter, brought fear to the battlefield. Many of the Empire’s enemies have now got used to the weapon and are not so wary of it. Even so, a volley of gunfire from well-drilled massed ranks is an awe inspiring and terrifying spectacle.</p><p>Handgunners can make good adventurers, given time away from their regiment. As well as the usual expertise and discipline of a trained soldier, their specialist equipment will give a party an edge in ranged combat and bring a certain fear-factor to the fight. Though do not expect them to be so useful on stealthy or surreptitious missions.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">The Nuln Ironsides</h4><p>The Nuln Ironsides are a product of the Imperial Gunnery School’s search for military advances. They are an elite regiment hand-picked from other Handgunner regiments and equipped with the best equipment the Imperial Gunnery School has to offer. Not only do they carry state of the art handguns, but they wear heavy armour. This is a telling factor when they engage with rival ranged troops, but also makes the difference if they are ever drawn into melee.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">The Fireloques of Ferlangen</h4><p>A troop of deadly accurate handgunners that have fought throughout Ostland, often under the army banner of the Elector Count himself. Wearing the black and white of their home province the Fireloques of Ferlangen bear no formal insignia, but superstitiously decorate their hats and uniforms with the bones of fallen comrades and other good luck charms.</p><p>Even amongst the stubborn Ostlanders, the Fireloques of Ferlangen have gained a reputation for tenacity, holding their gun line and unleashing volleys of fire into approaching foes. Their refusal to surrender the flank against Skaeling marauders during the three-day Battle of the Littered Bones earned them the nickname of Skull Clubbers, as without gunpowder for the entire last day they resorted to using their guns as blunt weapons.</p><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-up-in-arms/assets/actors/handgunner.webp\" width=\"351\"

haven’t noticed any smell of manure — why is it even relevant?’ </p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>- Ludmilla Krabbe, old artillerist on being asked about the noise of battle</em></p><p>‘I have fought in many wars, been overrun by ravenous beastmen, tortured by greenskins, seen the very air warped by daemons, but I have never been on the receiving end of cannon fire, thank Sigmar.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\">– <em>Ludmilla Krabbe</em></p></blockquote><p><em>You bring the big guns to the fight. You maintain and fire artillery and understand the best use of blackpowder.</em></p><p>The pride and joy of the Empire, its artillery is famed for an awe-inspiring spectacle that strikes fear into the heart of all her enemies. However, artillery regiments do not possess the glamour of the knightly orders or the Greatswords. It is hard graft involving heavy lifting, fetching, carrying, and tedious excavation. Despite this, it is vital to the Empire’s war effort and artillerists see themselves as the unsung heroes of the Empire’s armies.</p><p>The firepower of the Imperial army is only matched, and of course surpassed, by that of the Dwarfs. The Dwarfs have had a long head-start on developing their great weapons of war, but the Humans believe they are catching up fast. Dwarven artillerists are welcomed into the ranks of the Imperial army, in the knowledge that they will be expert and reliable, but also in the hope that they might reveal some of their secrets.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">The Imperial Gunnery School</h4><p>The vast majority of the Empire’s artillery pieces are forged at the Imperial Gunnery School in Nuln. A sprawling array of smelters, factories, and forges dominates the city, belching clouds of soot into the air and turning the night sky red. This is the centre of the industry in the Empire.</p><p>The Empire’s best artillerists are also trained here, and the Imperial Gunnery School is a pride of the city, proving to its citizens, once more, that it is better than Altdorf. Graduates of the school are respected and welcomed into every army in the Empire for their training and expertise.</p><p>Adventuring might seem an odd choice for an artillerist, especially as a cannon or other great weapon is not very convenient to drag around. But an artillerist does possess a good all-round set of skills and talents and have a range of outdoor skills. They would get respect from other members of the military and unlike most military, would be decently educated and able to hold their own in conversation with scientists and engineers.</p><p>An artillerist could get dragged into investigating wrongdoing or an evil conspiracy as easily as the next adventurer. After all, bravery in the face of the enemy and an inquiring mind are all an adventurer ever requires and artillerists must possess both attributes. And perhaps, in certain circumstances, they might even get to bring their cannon along.</p><h3 class=\"no-toc\">The State of the Art</h3><p>Though various forms of artillery have been used for millennia, innovations occur all the time. Some of the more exotic pieces of artillery are detailed below. See @UUID[JournalEntry.l0NZFxzG4t0GoIFu]{Artillery and Damage to Structures} for rules for artillery.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">Organ Gun</h4><p>The Organ Gun is the pride of Dwarven engineering. It comprises a number of barrels that are fired simultaneously. It usually has four or five barrels, though accounts tell of Dwarf holds protected by nine-barrel (and even greater) Organ Guns. The weapon strikes fear into the enemy by combining massive firepower with Dwarf reliability.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">Flame Cannon</h4><p>The Dwarven Flame Cannon is a dangerous weapon, sometimes even to its own side. It fires a stream of pressurised oil towards the enemy while attempting to ignite it. If all goes well, the results are deadly and terrible. Though not a blackpowder weapon, the famous Flame Cannon counts as an artillery weapon.</p><p>Many diplomatic missions have travelled from Altdorf and Nuln to various Dwarf holds offering generous trade deals in return for the secret of the Flame Cannon, though always without success. One artillerist, sent to the mountains to steal such secrets, was returned to the Empire, barely recognisable, burned to a crisp by the weapon whose secrets she sought. A note from the Dwarfs was enclosed, apologising for an unfortunate accident.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">Hellblaster Volley Gun</h4><p>It’s not just the Dwarfs who create such fantastical blackpowder weapons. The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.85UN6bKPTfGEBtBb.JournalEntryPage.HYkHeQZtD2AML3oG]{Imperial College of Engineers} in Altdorf is always experimenting with novel and pioneering cannons. The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-up-in-arms.items.4QBQvmOTtqeH4gUS]{Hellblaster Volley Gun} is an Imperial slant on the Organ Gun. The Volley Gun only fires three barrels at once but is arranged in a triangle of three banks of three barrels. This means it can fire three times before it needs reloading. Unfortunately, the weapon is notoriously unreliable and is prone to jamming, or worse, at crucial moments.</p><p> </p><p> </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Like mobile cities, the armies of the Old World rely on complex supply chains and strict organisation to keep them fed and supplied. Much of this is directly under the remit of the army. But private enterprise is always on the lookout for profit, so much of any army will be made up of an eclectic band of hangers on, pedlars, bawds, tradespeople, artisans, and charlatans. Many of these can be described using other careers, but those dedicated to following the troops without any specific trade or vocation come under the auspices of Camp Follower.</p><p>Camp Followers have a varying reputation. Many are simply honest traders making a living by supplying soldiers. The presence of a nearby army is a ready market for their goods, and it makes sense for them to stick by it, for safety and profit. Others are not so honest, taking advantage of the naïveté of recruits and the scarcity of supplies to profiteer or pass off shoddy wares. These petty charlatans live on their wits, of course, as exploiting the heavily armed and belligerent is not always the wisest business plan.</p><p>Some are specialist tradesmen and crafters performing many of the services vital to the functioning of an army, from blacksmiths to gunsmiths, tailors to cobblers. Armies generally employ their own labour for many of these purposes but a skilled artisan with a good reputation can charge a premium, especially when the quality of their work can be a matter of life and death. Reputations, good and bad, are quick to travel within an army and veteran soldiers are discerning customers.</p><p>Many Camp Followers are the partners and children of the soldiers themselves. Some soldiers consider this to be the best way to look after their family and it offers them some of the comforts of home while on campaign. These Camp Followers are also able to make money in addition to their partner’s military pay by acquiring a trade useful to the army. Others make money by performing similar functions and, getting used to such a way of life, look to marry into the army.</p><p>The presence of a large contingent of followers is a blessing and a curse for the army. On the one hand, they perform much needed jobs, often more efficiently than the army can manage in-house, and they enhance morale. On the other, they need to be defended, which involves diverting resources from other duties, and their presence can be unpredictable as they do not have the discipline and the respect for orders that soldiers do.</p><p>Life in the camp resembles that of a small town, with many of the same sort of interactions and interdependencies. There is the added complexity that the physical structures are temporary, and everyone is living under the threat of imminent attack. Not surprisingly, in a society dedicated to soldiering, life there can be nasty, brutal, and short. Many will perform whatever sordid and lowly services they can for whoever will pay.</p><p>With a reputation for rudeness, opportunism, and dishonesty, Camp Followers are treated with disdain by the more respectable citizens of the Empire and avoided. The established pecking order is as complex and as difficult to navigate as in any city, but much more dangerous, and whatever meagre status one can acquire is bitterly fought for.</p><p>The ruthlessness of the camp is never more in evidence than in the aftermath of battle. The poorest and most desperate pick their way across the battlefield cruelly stripping the dead and dying from both sides of whatever items of value they can find, left behind by the scavenging victorious soldiers. This is where the Camp Follower’s reputation for greed and brutality is earned.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\"><em>DEAD CONCERNED</em></h3><ul><li><p><em>Captain Rudolf Ratzenberger has been in a simmering secret feud with rival Captain Felice Fullermann ever since she bested him in a duel for the Regimental Cup.

was falling, so me and the lads crawled through the mud, past the enemy lines, dispatched a couple of beasties on our way. And when we got to the post, there was just a single survivor there, quill in hand, hunched over a rock. We told him we had to get out of there quick. He asked for twenty minutes more as he needed to finish off a particularly tricky set of contours.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Holger Kass, 1st Bögenhafen Halberdiers</em></p><p>‘So, the lord of the manor wants a plan of seven box stalls for his new stables. He won’t say how big he wants them, what he wants them to look like, what they’re made of, how they’re constructed, and he won’t pay the going rate, but he wants a nice map, and he wants it yesterday.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Anonymous cartographer</em></p></blockquote><p><em>You are hired to survey and map far flung locations. The more the area is in need of mapping, the more dangerous the job is likely to be.</em></p><p>As the world gets more sophisticated there is a need to map it in increasing detail. Whether this involves exploring largely unknown lands and making sweeping maps of the general area or going into exacting detail over small tracts in petty land disputes, cartographers are increasingly in demand.</p><p>No one needs maps more than the military. They have an insatiable requirement for whatever ones they can get and they have the money to commission more. Many of the Empire’s cartographers learn their trade in the military, either employed directly in the ranks or contracted as an outsider. The artillery is the most appreciative of good maps which allow them to target their machineries of destruction with greater accurately.</p><p>Older cartographers generally tire of such a perilous lifestyle and many set themselves up as urban professionals taking less interesting — but often more lucrative — work, commissioned by wealthy landowners, businesses, and governments. Whereas a noble would traditionally commission portraits of their family by the finest artists they can afford, aspiring merchants are as likely to commission maps of their holdings and their trade routes, and every town needs a large map of the borough displayed in the town hall.</p><p>The science of mapmaking is still in its infancy and many maps are little more than pictures or rough plans. Good draughtsmanship is harder to find and accurate maps are often underappreciated. New-fangled devices like theodolites are now must-haves for any self-respecting cartographer, allowing much more accuracy but requiring painstaking and methodical measurements.</p><p>Keen cartographers will always find opportunities for adventure. Any exploration or exotic journey would benefit from having a cartographer along. The further afield the travel, the more necessary this might be. A good number of jobs might require exacting drawings or plans, in the name of science or larceny, and this can lead to all different types of adventure. Simply being commissioned to travel to a specific area and making as detailed a plan of it as possible is bound to lead to any number of dangers and discoveries.</p><p>Old, discovered maps can lead to adventures, too, and often require an experienced cartographer to interpret. Another benefit of having a cartographer along on an adventure is that you can map your exploits and sell it to those who come after you.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>BOTHERSOME BORDERS</em></h3><ul><li><p><em>Nasty Jack Raven and his eleven crew members have made a pact that they should not return to their buried treasure until the entire company agrees. He needs a cartographer who can copy down elements of the master map such that all the pieces must need to be present to find the treasure. Of course, once the maps are complete, Nasty Jack will want to ensure that no one who knows the whole picture remains alive.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Anyone can claim to have civilised a bit of land in the Border Princes. But to really set yourself up as a noble there, you need to prove your claim by getting it accurately mapped, even if you haven’t bothered to get rid of all the Greenskins and other monsters in the area. A heavy-handed mapping expedition might kill two birds with one stone.</em></p></li></ul></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Rather than charge headlong into the teeth — and pikes — of the foe, Tilean light cavalrymen, called <em>Stradioti</em> in their language, prefer to strike from the flanks or, best of all, the rear, where the enemy’s baggage train presents a tempting target.</p><p>Though <em>Stradioti</em> can come from any part of Tilea — typically the small towns and hinterlands of the great city-states — the original and still most highly regarded are born and raised among the mountain villages of the Appucini chain and the small holdings of the western Border Princes.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-up-in-arms/assets/actors/riding-horse.webp\" width=\"221\" height=\"217\" /></div><p>A life of constant raiding and defending against raids, whether from Humans, Goblins, or Beastmen, has bred mounted warriors who hit their target fast, cause as much confusion and panic as possible, and then ride away before the enemy can react. Light horsemen from the desert lands of Araby perform much like the Tilean <em>Stradioti</em> and many companies of Arabyan horsemen work with mercenary commanders. Ungol horsemen from the northern steppes also fulfil a similar role in the armies of Kislev, and their companies, known as rota, can be found working as mercenaries.</p><p>In the Empire, light cavalry units are employed mostly in the southern Grand Provinces and the Reikland, where their ability to function in both rough terrain and plains makes them useful as scouts and quick-reaction forces. Though still largely Tilean, more and more recruits are coming from Imperials looking for something more exciting than marching back and forth. Sudenland has long employed <em>Stradioti</em> to patrol its southern reaches, and The Elector’s Own Lancers is a highly regarded outfit.</p><p>The basic unit of light cavalry is the ‘Talon’, comprising one of each of the first three tiers. The Lance leads the unit, has the best armour, and fights with lance and javelin or bow.</p><p>The Squire wears only partial armour and fights to protect the unshielded side of the Lance. The Page is usually a youth in their teens learning the trade — riding, weapons, and basic first aid — while acting as a servant to the others and fighting on foot. The final tier is the Captain, who commands several Talons and makes contracts.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>A FIRESIDE TALE</em></h3><p><em>Late at night under the stars in a small town nestled into the Appucini foothills, a retired Stradiot goes back to telling his rapt grandchildren a tale of adventure.</em></p><p>‘That was a glorious day. The Duke of Alvazzo, just a jumped-up bandit who’d stumbled on a tower full of gold, had hired a bunch of Orcs to be his army while he made himself lord of the region. Promised ’em what every Orc wants — fresh tender Human flesh to eat, just like the meat clinging to your own bones!’</p><p><em>He laughed as his grandchildren gasped and squealed.</em></p><p>‘The locals hired us to put a stop to it, and the Captain’s plan was a good one. He pinned Alvazzo and his Orcs at the river, feinting like he was going to force a crossing. That gave me time to take most of the cavalry through an old forest track that came out in their rear. They never knew what hit them. Whooping and hollering, we charged into their camp like daemons from the Wastes. Just as Alvazzo started to organise a defence, the Captain struck across the ford, and that was it. The Orcs panicked and ran for the hills — those we didn’t cut down first. When it was over, not one in five got away. It was years before they’d show their ugly faces again.</p><p>‘Never did find Alvazzo, though. I heard later he’d made a fine meal for the Orc chief — as the main course. Not that I blame the Orc. As a mercenary, you want to get paid, and a deal is a deal.’</p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-up-in-arms/assets/actors/light-cavalry.webp\" width=\"474\"

Specialist","text":{"content":"<blockquote><p> ‘As they approached our hearts sank. Braganza’s men never lost or fled and we knew we were doomed. Our captain began to explain how safe we were behind the walls until a bolt took him through the throat. No one wanted to be next.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Gunther Friesheim, on the Capture of Schloss Adlerberg</em></p><p>‘Arrows are useless against a castle — you can only win by using heavy wall-breaching equipment, which is why Dwarfs are superior in siege warfare. If you are the besieger, you can’t hit anything worthwhile at all. If you are inside the castle, you might think arrow fire would be effective from the towers, but what would you prefer to be hit by — a pointy stick or a thirty-pound rock?’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Berndt Lavaspear, -1778 IC</em></p><p>‘Remember when you build a wall to shelter behind you are also building a trap. If the wall is strong and flanked by towers the enemy will be trapped — but if the wall is carried then the other walls will hem in your defenders and leave them ripe for massacre.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Attributed to Magnus the Pious, 2302 IC</em></p><p>‘The only possible way an attacker can carry one of those accursed stone forts is to advance under the heaviest barrage of missiles possible. This is where Elf forces achieve their greatest successes. The defenders, unable to spread out, are ripe for slaughter beneath a cloud of arrows, and cannot deploy much effective missile fire of their own, hampered by the limited arcs of fire within their walls.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Attributed to Allurian, -3325 IC</em></p></blockquote><p><em>It is your job to bring down castle walls and to keep others from doing so. Let other poor fools storm the walls — you’ll provide cover, or a more subtle way in.</em></p><p>Though besieging fortified places is common throughout the Old World — an art Humans learned from the Dwarfs — it has reached its highest refinement in Tilea, whose Siege Specialists even Dwarfs will grudgingly admit are ‘passable’.</p><p>Sieging became an art in Tilea during the age when cities and towns threw off their princes and needed to find ways past the castle walls of defiant rural nobility — or the walls of rival city-states. Simply camping outside until the defenders starve or surrender risks being caught in the open by a relief force, or seeing disease ravage one’s own army.</p><p>But storming a fortress almost inevitably means heavy casualties among the besiegers, something every commander wants to avoid. Skilled troops are expensive to train and maintain, and a captain who gains a reputation for bloodthirsty assaults soon finds it hard to recruit replacements. The Siege Specialist allows an army to shorten a siege at a reasonable cost in lives — the other side’s. At the same time, the daunting prospect of specialists outside the walls creates a need for specialists inside, ones who can intercept the enemy’s tunnels before the walls collapse.</p><p>In the Empire, Siege Specialists are mainly Dwarfs, thanks to their long shared history. Why hire anyone else, when you can have the best? But Tilean Siege Specialists are almost as good — and less expensive — and so are hired more and more by lesser nobles and freistadts who don’t want to pay ‘Dwarf rates’.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">Braganza’s Besiegers</h4><p>During his campaign of conquest Borgio the Besieger desired a new model of regiment. He demanded marksmen that could pick off defenders from rampart walls whilst withstanding missile fire aimed in their direction. He wanted the same men to be able to hold castle ramparts in defence of attack, provide covering fire for sappers and miners, man siege towers, and prove hardy fighters in the event of an enemy sally. Braganza’s crossbowmen, equipped with heavy armour and pavises, proved fit for the task — though their extensive expertise is reflected in their expensive rates.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\" class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\"><em>A VETERAN’S ADVICE</em></h3><p>‘No, you don’t get to go blowing things up right away, ya wet-pants recruit! You have to earn your way up to “banger”, as we call it. There’s a lot more to the job than just lightin’ a fuse and runnin’ for cover. I’ll explain it to you again, and this time pay attention! First you start as a crossbowman, picking enemies off the walls who are trying to kill our boys. You stay behind your pavise and watch, learn, and shoot. And if the enemy sallies out, you and that pavise are the first line of defence, so keep your sword sharp!</p><p>‘When you’ve learned that job, you move up to Sapper and down into the tunnels. You dig under the walls, rigging ’em so we can bring them down or sneak our boys into the castle, or sometimes you’re digging a covered ditch so the assault troops can get close without worrying about rocks getting dropped on their heads. Just keep your head about you down there. It can get rough if you run into enemy Sappers — or worse, know what I mean? Squeak-squeak.</p><p>‘If you survive all that, you might get to be a “banger,” or “artillerist”, as they like to call themselves. They get to play with them trebuchets, hurling rocks and even bombs to bust holes in the walls and smash the gates, or make life miserable inside. When the Sapper has dug his tunnel, it’s the banger who makes the whole thing go BOOM. Just try to be out of the tunnel before it goes off.’</p></blockquote><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-up-in-arms/assets/actors/siege-specialist.webp\" width=\"472\"

they didn’t look dangerous, more like a bunch of rich kids out to show off in their new armour. Very flashy they were, all gems and silk. We’ll have a bit of fun, we thought. Easy pickings, we thought. Well, anyone can make a mistake. Poor captain Malvino, last mistake he ever made.’</p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Overheard in the Old Pig and Whistle, Marienburg</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Discipline and drill. If you keep your wits about you and the enemy in front, no force on a battlefield, not even the heaviest Imperial knights, can stop a phalanx of Pikemen.</em></p><p>All towns and villages in the Old World have their militias, masses of armed residents who can be turned out on short notice to defend homes and fields or fight for a few weeks in their lord’s service. Their lack of discipline and desire to return home to families and trades, however, makes them of limited use on long campaigns or when facing heavily armed and armoured horsemen.</p><p>The Pikeman developed from Tilean militias when a need arose for infantry in long-term service who could stand up to armoured cavalry — or wolf-riding goblins. Formed in large squares with the first three ranks of pikes pointed forward and the rest held high to guard against arrows, the pike phalanx presents a formidable sight. Few animals willingly charge a forest of spear points pointed at them, and infantry must dodge multiple attackers before even closing with a pikeman.</p><p>But the phalanx has weaknesses. Not very manoeuvrable, it cannot execute swift turns or changes of face. Taken in the flanks — or worse, from behind — Pikemen are at risk of panic and a loss of discipline that can easily turn fatal. And so they are most commonly the core of a mercenary army, their vulnerable sides covered by cavalry and crossbowmen.</p><p>In the Empire, pike formations are less commonly employed, but can be found in the service of the State Armies of Reikland and Nuln. In peacetime, these troops also serve to restore order, the points of their pikes well-suited to clearing rioters from the streets.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">The Alcatani Fellowship</h4><p>The life of a farmer is never an easy one in the war-torn land of Tilea. Even wealthy landowners suffer. When Rodrigo Delmonte found his crops ruined by a rampaging army he embarked on the only course of action that remained to him, he became a soldier and led his workforce to Remas where he bought some shoddy suits of armour, a few second-hand helmets, and some slightly bent pikes. Despite their modest origins the Alcatani Fellowship has proven itself against Orc raiders in the wilds near Buccolia, and are earning a reputation for their effective and affordable phalanxes of pikemen.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">Ricco’s Republican Guard</h4><p>The Republican Guard were raised in Remas by merchants during the revolt that preceded the birth of the Republic. The regiment played a leading part in overthrowing the tyrannical Prince Mondo, parading his head around the city to the applause of the mob.</p><p>Desperate to bring in funds Captain Ricco led the Guard in search of employment in other Tilean cities. The Guard fought well, earning a reputation as an elite phalanx that survives to the present day.</p><h4 class=\"no-toc\">The Leopard Company</h4><p>The mercenaries of the Leopard Company fight hard to recover their lost honour. Their Captain, Leopold di Lucci, once contended with Lorenzo Lupo to be Prince of Luccini. Leopold’s men were losing ground, and blame fell on the Priests at Luccini’s Temple of the Leopard, who switched sides during the fighting. Leopold’s men threw the inconstant priests into the Tilean Sea.</p><p>Lorenzo prevailed and was hailed Prince of Luccini. Leopold and his men were exiled, and since then bad luck has dogged the company. Recently Leopold has arranged for a portion of the loot made by his men to be returned to the Temple, and the fortunes of the Leopard Company are improving.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>LESSON LEARNED</em></h3><p><em>Tilea, 1711 IC. From a hilltop surrounded by his Household Guard, Grand Count Maximilian III von Hochkirsche, Elector of Nuln, watched in grim silence as mercenaries hired by Miragliano routed his army.

Now his army was breaking, pursued by the advancing pikemen and harried by their cavalry. Sighing, he took quill and paper and began writing a note. Folding and sealing it, he handed it to a confused aide.</em> ‘Here, take this to their Captain. It is the only thing left to do.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Sir?

pursue the life of the knight, but without the obligations to, or the protection of, a Knightly Order.</em></p><p>Not all knights belong to an order, there are those who are knighted independently by a noble, others declare themselves a knight, and there are some who leave (or are thrown out…) of an Order to forge their own path. These are known as ‘freelancers’, knights who fight for coin, honour, or some peculiar motive of their own.  Some are hardened mercenaries or little better than bandits. Others are champions of the downtrodden or selfless unsung heroes of the people.</p><p>Freelancers are as diverse as their origins. They wear their own colours, which may be a family crest if they are noble or heraldry of their own devising. Eccentric arms and armour are common, assembled from their own preferences or whatever they can obtain and maintain. They are often viewed with suspicion, as they have no Order to vouch for their disposition, but if their actions are heroic, they can become popular.  Advancement outside an order is unstructured — typically a freelancer grows their retinue and eventually leads their own troop of knights. An example of this is Voland’s Venators, a notoriously rowdy band of knights who fight as mercenaries in Tilea, the Border Princes, and the Empire.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img

Mrs. Bramblewine, how’s Alfie? Oh, that’s a shame, but I’m sure your amazing raspberry tarts will soon have his leg on the mend! What?

You know me, I go weak at the knees when I’m offered a bit o’ crumpet…”</p><p style=\"text-align:right\">– Bundlebrew Skelfsider, Greenleafs Fieldwarden</p></blockquote><p>Halflings prefer militias to standing armies, and have little apparent military strength to those unfamiliar with their ways. Visitors to the Moot often wonder at how the countryside and villages remain so peaceful and idyllic despite sharing a border with dread Sylvania where the dead never rest, with no obvious armies to repel them. A large part of the credit for this goes to the Field Wardens. These brave halflings patrol the borders of the Moot, using their intimate knowledge of the terrain and cunning guerrilla tactics to deter unwanted visitors. A Field Warden is first and foremost a Halfling of the people, a friendly face to reassure the public that all is well. They know every family in their area (and which baked treats they are likely to serve a Field Warden who happens to be passing by around tea time). It is a highly respected position, and any Field Warden can expect a busy off-duty calendar as families invite them to Bakeday meals, wedding feasts, funeral remembrance dinners or pie eating competitions. </p><p>Those attached to border patrols see much more in the way of action. The Moot is a fertile, bountiful place, and greatly coveted by bandits, greenskins and petty nobles who think themselves above province borders. Such intruders soon find the land is not as defenceless as it looked, and most beat a hasty retreat under a hail of expertly aimed sling stones from concealed Field Wardens. Along the Sylvanian border, Field Wardens are posted no longer than one week per month, to ensure none suffer the stress of the walking dead for too long. Even during times of “peace” with the Vampire Counts of Sylvania, most patrols are guaranteed to encounter at the very least a pack of rotting zombies shambling over the border. Due to this unsavoury but very necessary duty, veteran Field Wardens often surprise other adventurers (Priests and Witch Hunters are often very surprised indeed) with their experience in combating necromancy.</p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-archives1/assets/actors/fieldwarden.webp\" width=\"344\" height=\"436\"

A landslide might render a surface route impassable, and every year more underground territory is lost to the greenskins, or a once-safe bridge is torn down by the relentless gnawing of the Raki. It is the duty of the Karak Ranger to patrol these routes and keep them safe, or establish new paths where an old one has become too dangerous. A Karak Ranger’s survival hinges on preparedness; there is little company or comfort to be found along the ancient dark tunnels or secret mountain passes, and even less chance of help should he encounter danger. One must be prepared to leap large chasms, climb sheer surfaces, or cross large bodies of water (or sewage, or even lava), depending on the route. Every bush, every shadow, may contain dangers, waiting to pounce. A Karak Ranger must be tough and adaptable to survive, by turns able to hunt, scout, and fight, or even repair a bridge mid-expedition.</p><p>Karak Rangers often spend many months in the field, far away from civilisation. Where human or halfling rangers are often seen by society as becoming wild like nature itself (most dwarves believe elves were always uncivilised tree-lovers), a Karak Ranger remains true to his people; The mountains are brutal and unforgiving, and to live in “harmony” with them would be to abandon one’s traditions and clan, an unthinkable prospect. Karak Rangers seek to tame the wilds, not submit to them. Some Rangers train animal companions such as dogs, birds of prey or even hardy mountain goats, both for company and aid in scouting and hunting. </p><div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-archives1/assets/actors/karak-ranger.webp\" width=\"330\" height=\"491\" /></div><p><strong>Species: </strong>Dwarf</p><p><strong>Class: </strong>Ranger</p><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\">Karak Ranger Advance Scheme</h3><table style=\"height:34px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:60px;text-align:center\">WS</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:60px;text-align:center\">BS</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:60px;text-align:center\">S</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\">T</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\">I</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\">Agi</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\">Dex</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\">Int</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\">WP</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\">Fel</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;width:60px;text-align:center\">✠</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:60px;text-align:center\">♟</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:60px;text-align:center\">✠</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\">✠</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\"> </td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\">♜</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\"> </td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\">♛</td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\"> </td><td style=\"height:17px;width:61px;text-align:center\"> </td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>✠ @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.items.fGgDpDWP5d0cDcWd]{Hold Runner}</strong></h3><p><strong>Status</strong>: Brass 3<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.sRuMlaPU5xdIrwhd]{Climb}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.1jCxbFAUuFuAPLJl]{Dodge}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.CcNJsS4jSwB6Ug1J]{Endurance}, <em>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.wKwel9MG7NIG3i3w]{Trade (Cartographer)}</em>, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.rOPmyLWa37e7s9v6]{Melee (Basic)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.os4NKy5Oy6sRt1eh]{Outdoor Survival}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.Fs06sr7y9JKpVQmB]{Perception}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.KL4pCOqma5E7fLG4]{Row}<br /><strong>Talents</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.xx8SgdWYEjKct7ym]{Implacable}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.afREA9q7v4Scuozn]{Orientation}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.1dUizIgLBgn4jICC]{Strider (any)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.FF41XPboORgyDNsv]{Strong Back}<br /><strong>Trappings</strong>: Backpack, Hand Weapon, Leather Jack, Trade tools (Cartographer)<br /><br /></p><h3><strong>♟ @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.items.fRkh5R4ocyLgOwzO]{Karak Ranger}</strong></h3><p><strong>Status</strong>: Silver 1<br /><strong>Skills</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.4IGdIhnwTaZijzg7]{Charm Animal}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.cYtU0ORRFCOpQLWz]{Intuition}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.H2upcZ7q7qAPtPic]{Ranged (Blackpowder)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.COND1RfSn9v58QiN]{Secret Signs (Scout)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.6l2JkMfD3mNxqiep]{Secret Signs (Ranger)}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.skills.rt2rGSwFDCDHPh0A]{Track}<br /><strong>Talents</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.4MJJCiOKPkBByYwW]{Strike Mighty Blow}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.MGEPI4jNhymNIRVz]{Scale Sheer Surface}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.AcnFuDKRemLI9ey7]{Nose for Trouble}, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.q58lK4kULJZB5GjE]{Rover}<br /><strong>Trappings</strong>: Blackpowder Weapon with Ammunition, Grappling Hook &amp;

Loec is a mysterious figure because his followers guard the secrets of his rites and purpose behind a veil of secrecy. His servants are occasionally called Feastmasters for their part in the great festivals, where they lead the celebration and perform intricate dances that recount the history of the Warding Woods. Loec appears to the Elves as a lithe youth who dances across the void, and his laughter stirs the souls and spirits that dwell there. Without him, it is said, the heavens would grow dull and cold, for the stars of the night sky would no longer have reason to remain wakeful.</p></div><p>Fyr Darric, the Trickster's Wood, is a High Realm of the Warding Woods, ruled by Lady Heggria of the Masque. Fyr Darric is Loec the Trickster's holy ground within the Warding Woods, the site of many shrines to his anarchic glory. Here too can be found the Feast Halls of the Wardance — the closest thing that the nomadic Wardancers of the Warding Woods have to a home. As a result, the glades of Fyr Darric always resound to the sound of laughter, though much of it is mean-spirited. Every deception requires a victim, and the consequences can range from wounded pride to a slow death.</p><p>Never is this more true that at the Festivals of the Equinox, when captives are promised their freedom, if only they can slay a Wardancer in single combat. None succeed, of course, for the Devo-tees of Loec are peerless duellists. The true con-test is not for the victim’s freedom, but to see how many wounds the Wardancer can inflict before his foe expires. Any captive who dies to fewer than a hundred cuts is thought to be poor sport indeed.</p><p></p><p>Other Wood Elves regard the Wardancers as wild and unpredictable, and not without cause, for they are the servants and worshippers of the Elven trickster god, Loec. The Wardancers lead the Elves in music and rejoicing, and perform the intricate dance rituals that re-enact the history of the Warding Woods, a form of storytelling more im-portant to the Wood Elves than the more conventional method of writing.</p><p>To a Wardancer, even other Elves appear to be moving painfully slowly, for every move made by one of the kin of Loec flows into the next, and thence the next one after that without conscious thought or guidance. Forgoing armour, the Wardancers decorate themselves with swirling designs and dye their hair in bright colours, taking on the roles of mythical figures and ferocious warriors, their form of movement, and even their fighting style, paying homage to the one who inspires their dance.</p><p>Wardancers are sublime warriors, made even more deadly through their war dances. For these, the favoured rituals of the Trickster God, no rhythm is called nor are orders issued. Instead, the dancers instinctively enact a pattern of lethal movements, complementing the dances performed by the rest of the troupe. Each Wardancer leaps and pirouettes through the enemy ranks to music only she hears, gracefully evading her opponent’s clumsy blows and ending his life with an impossibly swift to strike of her own.</p><p>Shadowdancers are the closest thing that the Trickster God has to a priesthood, and they are both respected and feared as a result. Shadowdancers, and Shadowdancers only, know all the paths through the Warding Woods — indeed, it is said that they tread the paths of the Dreaming Wood as surely as they do the mortal world. In battle, they are even more dazzlingly swift than other Wardancers. At other times they are less flamboyant, preferring to confound others with deceptions of the mind rather than swiftness of body. Indeed, many Shadowdancers can create illusions, which they inevitably use to further distract their foes or mete out a much needed dose of humility to Elves or spirits that have forgotten their station.</p></div></div><p> </p><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-akoris/art/Fylneth.jpg\" /><p></p><p><strong>Species: </strong>Wood Elf</p><p><strong>Class: </strong>Ranger</p><h3

They favour skullcaps, high-collared cloaks, and expensive robes in deep blues and blacks, emblazoned with silver and gold motifs to represent the night sky. Somewhere on their person they wear the symbol of their order, the Comet of Power. Many present a well-groomed, aloof appearance to the world.</p>\n<p>Each magister carries a staff, usually topped with an ornamental telescope, miniature orrery, or armillary sphere.

After passing rigorous exams, new apprentices (called acolytes) are expected to serve their master without complaint — taking observations, readying instruments, fetching tomes, uncovering research, and undertaking any menial task that an astromancer considers beneath them.</p>\n<p>The most perilous and humiliating chore is cleaning the college’s glass domes of bird droppings. When their master does not want to travel, acolytes may be sent on long distance errands to check an obscure detail from a premonition or to witness a meteorological phenomenon.</p>\n<div

and deceitful, you combine the abilities of wizard and spy.</em></p>\n<p>The only thing a Grey Wizard is certain of is that nothing is certain in this world, and that things are rarely as they seem. They know that lies often cover up other lies and become so used to falsehood and deception that they have trouble recognizing the truth as it is.</p>\n<p>Shadowmancers are distrustful people, who rarely believe what they see at face value and always look for false bottoms, hidden meanings, and concealed motives. In return, they are careful to withold their own beliefs and intentions. Truth has value, they’ve learned, and items of value shouldn’t be just given away.</p>\n<p>Despite their natural mistrust, they are good diplomats and spies. Many Grey Wizards work at noble courts, in mercantile houses, or in criminal organisations — although often in a different profession, keeping their identity as a wizard hidden. Sometimes they even maintain two or more roles at the same time. Shadowmancers are masters of disguise and adept at maintaining several identities. At the same time they are socially adept and can relate to people — if only because that makes it easier to deceive them.</p>\n<p>Grey Wizards don’t spend much time at their college grounds in Altdorf. Those who are not engaged in cloak and dagger plots prefer to travel throughout the Empire, and even across its borders. Doing so permits them to learn about the state of the Empire and assess the dangers that threaten it from within. Grey Guardians travelling the Empire often arrange to meet their colleagues at particular places at certain days of the year. Sometimes it’s just an encounter between two travellers, other times a group of shadowmancers gather for a few days at an inn or out in the fields. During these encounters and gatherings the wizards share information they’ve learned, and in doing so, get a more complete image of whatever threats exist.</p>\n<div class=\"journal-image

Of course, the next morning, we discovered he’d burned down our barn.’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>– Arnold Fleiss, Innkeeper</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>You feed off your raw passion and emotional energy to bring magical firepower to the battlefield.</em></p>\n<p>Bright Wizards are the most belligerent of all the wizards of the Empire. This is common knowledge. Though other colleges are known for their particular sort of aggression, and all serve the military in one capacity or another, the Bright College brings shock and awe to the battlefield like none other. This reputation may lack nuance and be the result of unsophisticated accounts by common soldiers and fraught enemies, but it is steeped in truth. The Bright Wizards often adopt a warlike and fearsome appearance, their staffs made of iron and topped with a brazier ready to wield all-consuming flame.</p>\n<p>The Bright Wind is also associated with emotion. Passion bordering on anger seems to drive Bright Wizards. Part of learning to be a pyromancer is to allow one’s emotions to run free, to enable the gathering of <em>Aqshy</em>. But the key to real power as a Bright Wizard is knowing how to master passion, knowing where to draw the line, and being able to stop oneself from being consumed by such seductive power. Practices to aid control are a large part of the wizard’s training.</p>\n<p>To help with such discipline and self-control and to engender humility, apprentices spend the first period of their apprenticeship undertaking the most menial of chores. They are required to stoke the furnaces that continually burn within the depths of the college, and to scrub the soot encrusted chambers at the heart of the complex. They carry sacks of coal through the building and shovel it into giant hoppers. They must meticulously maintain the mundane paraphernalia that ultimately underlies all the magical functions of the college. This period might be boring and laborious, but it necessitates rest and recuperation which in turn allows an apprentice some time to themselves to savour the delights of Altdorf.</p>\n<div

He ended up sleeping in the stable. I was gonna let him stay for free, but he said it was the best room in the Inn. So I charged him the same price as the luxury suite.’</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>— Arnold Fleiss, Innkeeper</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Ruled by your magical affinity you are drawn instinctively to the wild places and its great beasts.</em></p>\n<p>Amber Wizards are known for their feral appearance and lifestyle, more at home in the wilderness than the town, and with more affinity for animals than their fellow Humans. Many wander the Empire’s vast untamed landscape, but just as many find a place they like and settle there. Every village in the Empire has a story of a local monster, giant, or witch who lives in the forest and is to be feared but is seldom encountered. More often than not, this is an Amber Wizard.</p>\n<p>Some wizards do interact and cooperate with the people of nearby villages. Though they are more comfortable on their own and loathe to be disturbed, many are kind enough to help and advise local communities when they need it. The superstitious folk of the Empire, being what they are, often shun the Amber Wizards in return.</p>\n<p>Just as there is little formal hierarchy within the Amber Order, there is no formal system for entering it as an apprentice. Wizards are always on the lookout for potential apprentices, those with a spark of the magical about them and an instinct for the wild. Some wizards even steal babies from the crib, they say. More likely, if a shaman comes across a potential young recruit, they will reach an agreement with their parents to take them on. However feared wizards might be among the folk of the Empire, few parents are not going to feel some sort of pride and accomplishment if their offspring is raised into such lofty ranks.</p>\n<div

The wizards of the Bright Order wear robes of blazing red and orange.</p>\n<p>Bright Wizards are considered the greatest war wizards of the Colleges of Magic. They know many spells of destruction, and their ability to cast fiery blasts is a visible reminder of their power. A Bright Wizard can wield flame like a sword or raise a curtain of fire to confound their enemies. Such abilities are obvious in their power and very destructive, and few ordinary folk would wish to seek the assistance of a Bright Wizard in any trivial matter. The powers of the pyromancers are not well suited to subtle tasks. Where they bend their will, ruin and destruction is sure to follow, whatever is intended.</p>\n<h3>Semiotics of the Bright Order</h3>\n<p>The symbol of the Seventh Lore is the Key of Secrets. It symbolises the unlocking of power through knowledge. Indeed, progression through the eight ranks of the Bright College is marked at every transition by the aspirant’s passage through a filigreed gate, each more imposing than the last. The Key of Secrets is central to the traditions and rituals of the Bright Wizards, and wizards of the college often carry keys as a symbol of their authority. The more keys a wizard carries, and the heavier the chains with which they are bound, the greater their power and higher their standing within the order. This is not to say that the Key of Secrets is a purely figurative symbol of power. Masters of the college have, as part of their ceremonial regalia, a bunch of seven keys of differing metals.</p>\n<p>Amongst the wizards of the order, it is common to joke that just as their knowledge is the key to power, so their power grants them the key to open all doors. After all, few gates or portals can withstand the focused fury of a determined Bright Wizard. Other symbols associated with the pyromancers are the flame and the burning torch. Wizards skilled in the pyromantic arts wear red tattoos upon their arms and faces. These are said to writhe and change form to make the spells of fire.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>When a Sirocco Blows</em></h3>\n<p><em>The magical energies of </em>Aqshy <em>gutter like flame in the breeze and run wild over hot sands and sun-baked fields. It is powerful where there is flame and fire and is whipped into a frenzy as it swirls over the volcanoes of the Worlds Edge Mountains. All flame becomes a vortex for </em>Aqshy <em>magic, and the rites of the Bright College are rites of fire.</em></p>\n<p><em>Bright Wizards gain +1 SL to Channelling (Aqshy) Tests when close to significant fires, such as bonfires or burning buildings. If near a great conflagration, such as the vicinity of an active volcano or a town on fire, this bonus increases to +2 SL.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Scions of the Flame</h3>\n<p>As an apprentice’s potential is stoked in the glowing halls of the Bright College, they begin to display the keys of their order, denoting their position within it. They are given a single symbolic key when entering the college, but as their career progresses, they are awarded more keys which they carry ostentatiously on a ring hanging from their belt. Some of these are symbolic of their rank and of their progress. Some are functional, allowing them access to erstwhile forbidden libraries, laboratories, and workshops in the college. Only when a magister reaches the rank of Pyromancer Lord will they have collected all the Seven Secret Keys of the College.</p>\n<p>Because of the spectacular and destructive nature of their magic, Bright Wizards are often considered the most influential of all the colleges upon the Empire’s military. This is a reputation that the pyromancers, and other more subtle colleges, are happy to maintain. It is certainly true that many of the Empire’s greatest victories have been won with a Bright Wizard prominent upon the battlefield, and the nation’s greatest generals would be loath to take the field without a Bright Wizard to hand.</p>\n<p>The Bright Wizard is trained specifically with a career in the military in mind. Many apprentices are sent to join regiments to learn what military life is like and to aid senior magisters on campaign. In this way, a wizard is likely to find a powerful long-term mentor who might guide their career and teach them the tricks of the trade.</p>\n<p>A young apprentice joining a new regiment is likely to fill their fellow soldiers with suspicion and some fear. Until they prove themselves on the field of battle and demonstrate their reliability, the common soldier has better things to do than support such a neophyte mage. Newly arrived apprentices are encouraged to take the field as soon as possible and throw whatever spells they have at the enemy or are sent on special missions in the hope that any weak links are soon disposed of. A good number of apprentices, therefore, do not make it beyond their first mission.</p>\n<p>Not all apprentices are sent to the military. Those who possess resourcefulness and initiative are often given other jobs by the college. While not the most subtle of institutions, the Bright College still requires intelligence, investigation, and communication. Where errands cannot be trusted to the usual Imperial institutions, apprentice pyromancers are called upon. The brightest of Brights often find themselves sent to far-flung corners of the Empire, and even beyond, at the behest of their college, carrying messages or fetching artefacts.</p>\n<h3>Graduates of the Bright College</h3>\n<p>If a Bright Wizard survives their apprenticeship, there are several directions their career might take. These will be dictated by the higher-ranking wizards but will be based on their strengths and their career so far. Those who have shown initiative might be trusted to continue their work in a more independent manner. Provided they make themselves available to be called up at short notice, they will be given free rein and expected to advance the cause of their college however they see fit. This is, of course, a great advantage for the adventure-minded magister.</p>\n<p>Other wizards are sent off to the army and are likely to stay associated with their regiment for their entire career. They might also go on specific missions for the college and often need to travel back and forth between Altdorf and their regiment. They often retain bonds of comradeship with their old regiment — there have been issues with divided loyalties between college and regiment in the past, but the wizard should always be aware their first loyalty is to the Bright College.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Red Wind","type":"text","_id":"NR69EPiMhbeKPook","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><em>Aqshy</em> is a hot, dry wind that blows from the Realm of Chaos like the desert winds across arid dunes. It is attracted to hot places and emotion. It can be found almost anywhere but gathers around the hearth and braziers. It lingers in warm nooks and in the soot and embers and coalesces around the warm-hearted and hot-headed. It is easier to channel during the day, and in the warmth.</p><p>There are two seemingly distinct elements that focus <em>Aqshy</em>. That of the physical world, of fire and heat, and that of the emotional, warmth of personality and spirit, the heat of friendship and love. Passion and anger attract <em>Aqshy</em> and aid in its channelling. Just as the wind might be seen brightly spewing from a raging bonfire or drifting around a cooked meal, it can be discerned in the gestures of an angered person or glowing in the features of a cheery soul.</p><p>The wind appears as a red, hazy shimmer obscuring the real world as if it is a mirage. It glows almost white hot as it is manipulated, bursting into dancing flames. Sparks crackle and spit at a magister’s fingertips as they trace shapes in the air. Then it darkens as it diminishes and turns to black wisps of smoke and spent embers, and in a magister’s wake the ground seems to char and crack. The aftermath of Pyromancy is a stultifying, dry atmosphere, where it may feel hard to breathe. Wisps of smoke might still play in the air, and the smell of burning hangs heavy, and the centre of the magical effect may appear scorched and blackened.</p><p>The wind is associated with violence and aggression. The magical effects are often spectacular, involving raging fires and massive destruction. Those who wield the Bright Wind are the most conspicuous of all wizards upon the Empire’s battlefields, and the pyromancer is the ideal war wizard. It can be uncontrolled rage personified. But when controlled, and applied thoughtfully, the wind can be used delicately. Spells like @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.2ZiUoYRgh54WaC7L]{Cauterise} and Comfort showcase more subtle and warming effects that Bright magisters can facilitate.</p><h3>The Bright College</h3><p>The @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.Fp4H6KTNkCF5P5JN]{Bright College} itself is an austere red brick structure — once nestled among busy streets, it now sits apart behind a moat of scorched earth and blackened ruins. The burned-out houses are the result of a series of fires that have mysteriously erupted in the area over the years. The college of course denies all responsibility for this and blames either coincidence or a conspiracy of their enemies. After all, what could possibly undermine the safety of the Empire more than if the people of Altdorf were to lose faith in their Bright Wizards?</p><p>The building is surrounded by a brick wall surmounted by wrought iron railings, and ornate iron gates guard the entrance. Six spectacular towers rise from the brutal structure like chimneys from a furnace, sending incessant plumes of dark smoke into the Altdorf sky. At night the place can be seen as a silhouette against a fiery orange backdrop. The towers are topped by a gigantic beacon that burns both day and night, casting an eerie red glow over the entire college and illuminating the sorcerous inner realm that is the Bright College. Occasionally, great stone gargoyles perched up high belch forth white-hot lava that spills down the side of the building towards unseen receptacles, in a spectacle of light and sparks.</p><p>The interior of the college is stark brick and stone. Little that is flammable is left exposed in the common areas. The entire complex bathes in a hot red glow, lit by sconces and braziers. Though the building includes few windows there is a convoluted system of ducts, funnels, and chimneys which serves to keep air circulating throughout the complex, regulating the temperature and exhausting smoke and other fumes. It is still stifling and smoky in there, however, and though the magisters do get used to it, it is oppressive to visitors.</p><p>The building is designed around a communal domed area which more resembles a kiln than the dome of a temple. This central chamber is well lit by the usual sources, and a steady stream of thick smoke emerges from the chimney at its apex.</p><p>The working areas of the college are less austere, and behind locked doors there are libraries and laboratories. These are richly appointed with all manner of paraphernalia. After learning several painful lessons, these rooms keep most of their fires behind glass screens and metal fireguards.</p><h3>Relationships</h3><h4>The Military</h4><p>The Imperial military often works hand in glove with the Bright College. Ultimately the army is commanded by the Emperor, and so negotiations with that office can go as high as the Privy Council, and there is a pyromancer always on hand at the Imperial Palace to give the College’s opinion when it is asked for. As @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.actors.wkR7O1KYE9qaXntF]{Thyrus Gormann}, head of the Bright College, has also held the positon of Supreme Patriarch, this gives the college a great deal of power. Gormann himself is one of the Emperor’s closest advisors and Bright Wizards on official business can always get their voices heard at the Palace.</p><p>Military matters are usually settled at a lower level, however, and the responsibility for a single army stops with its general. Any force worth its place on the battlefield has an accompanying wizard, and though wizards from all the colleges join the military, Bright Magisters have the most visible role, and possibly the biggest influence. In military matters, wizards of other colleges often show subservience to Bright Wizards, in public, if not in private.</p><p>As the military can call upon Bright Wizards to do their bidding, so is the Bright College able to call upon the military when they require a show of physical force. They, of course, trust only wizards and apprentices on magical matters, but for more mundane errands the army is only too keen to give the Bright College armed back-up.</p><h4>The Imperial Gunnery School in Nuln</h4><p>The Imperial Gunnery School in Nuln has long looked upon the Bright College as a rival within the Imperial military. Not only are they based in Altdorf, close to the Imperial Palace and apt to worm their way into the Emperor’s ear, they bring dangerous concepts to the army. The principles of Bright Magic and blackpowder are similar enough. One, however, is safe and reliable and informed by a hierarchy of reasonable scientists, the other is wayward and dangerous and in the hands of a few hot-headed, and possibly unstable, individuals.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Sergov Pfeiffer","type":"text","_id":"JnSAUMukQSp1hEbd","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"journal-image centered\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/actors/sergov-pfeiffer.webp\" width=\"297\" height=\"301\" /></div><p style=\"text-align:center\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.u2tiVh3bjxz8pBxb]{Sergov Pfeiffer}</p><p>Pfeiffer can often be found at one of any number of his favourite drinking dens, gaming and what have you, at least as much as he can be found at the college. His evenings are as likely to end up in a fist fight down a dark alleyway as in a debate on the order of superiority of the Winds of Magic or the practical application of consistent power structures in ritual magic. Senior pyromancers are beginning to despair of these antics and they are considering a posting far to the east to teach him proper military discipline.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.u2tiVh3bjxz8pBxb]{Pfeiffer} burns the candle at both ends. While he is at the college he is constantly at work, diligently pursuing some element of advanced research or referencing spells supposedly beyond his rank. Because of his other pursuits, this seems to escape the attention of his tutors. He is often up all night in an obscure library or working alone in a laboratory. Sometimes he combines both pursuits. He once brought Bretonnian brandy into a lab while researching the flammability of various substances, for example, and was still cleaning soot stains from the flagstones of the central quadrangle three weeks later.</p><p>All the while @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.u2tiVh3bjxz8pBxb]{Pfeiffer} is working on his magnum opus. He has in mind a singular spell that will bring destruction to all the Empire’s foes. Inspired by Sigmar himself, he dreams of a huge comet-like conjuration that will fall to earth with shattering effect, which he is calling The Fury of Sigmar.</p><p>One day, @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.u2tiVh3bjxz8pBxb]{Pfeiffer} realises, he will have to leave all this behind, properly knuckle down, and become just another of those humourless Master Wizards who leave the college to fight on the frontier, many of whom are never seen again. But for now, one more trip to the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.XhWgwj2BstdmYY95]{Street of One Hundred Taverns} can’t hurt.</p><h3>Pfeiffer as Patron</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.u2tiVh3bjxz8pBxb]{Pfeiffer} is not much use to the Characters as far as his rank and influence goes. Though from a wealthy family, he does not have much influence at the Bright College, having burned his bridges with his erratic behaviour and lack of inclination to court favour. But Pfeiffer does require a likely bunch who are prepared to do some of the dirty work involved in magical research and fetch and carry for him. In return, Pfeiffer will be able to protect the Characters from low level law enforcement and get them into places they might not normally have access to. Wizards are often considered beyond class hierarchy and so even the lowliest Characters might get the chance to mix with the well-heeled on the say-so of a magister.</p><p>Meetings with the Characters will take place on the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.XhWgwj2BstdmYY95]{Street of One Hundred Taverns}, most likely in a smaller, out of the way, tavern, over any number of drinks. @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.u2tiVh3bjxz8pBxb]{Pfeiffer} will be keen to go on somewhere after business has been settled, and then go on somewhere else, after that — it could be a long night.</p><h3>Black Book</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.u2tiVh3bjxz8pBxb]{Pfeiffer} has been in regular correspondence with Flaminus, a magister of Carroburg, for some years. However, the missives have suddenly stopped. Pfeiffer needs access to this wizard’s library and one book in particular, <em>Calidum Corpora</em>. He will send the Characters to fetch it. Unfortunately, Flaminus was suspected of dabbling in the profane and has been drowned by a witch hunter. His possessions have been placed in a vault beneath the Temple of Sigmar in Carroburg, and it will require some convincing arguments, or perhaps larceny, to get the book back.</p><p>The Characters should also be very careful they do not reveal their employer’s identity. No wizard needs a witch hunter on their trail whether they are licensed or not.</p><h3>Fired Up</h3><p>The landlord of one of @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.u2tiVh3bjxz8pBxb]{Pfeiffer's} drinking dens is getting upset about a spate of fires that have been erupting in his premises over the past couple of weeks. He has told everyone he suspects racketeers of arson. As a favour, Pfeiffer agreed to investigate it, and decided that the cause was an errant Fire Elemental. Now he needs the Characters to stake out the pub for as long as it takes for the elemental to strike again. He has created a trap for the creature, an iron sphere, because he wants to capture and study it. The only difficulty is that the Characters need to touch the elemental with the sphere to set the trap off.</p><p>To make things harder, the racketeers, members of the gang known as the Hooks, turn up wanting to know who’s been spreading rumours about them. What Pfieffer is not telling, however, is that he created the Elemental himself, as a drunken wheeze.</p><h3>Mixed Message</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.u2tiVh3bjxz8pBxb]{Pfeiffer} is close, he says, to a momentous breakthrough in his magical research, but actually he just wants to spend more time on the town. He has been ordered by the college to travel to some corner of the Empire and deliver a message to a Bright Wizard of a frontier regiment. This is the sort of thing, Pfeiffer reasons, that can be done by anyone, and does not require a wizard, so he needs to find a likely messenger able to pose as a pyromancer.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.actors.u2tiVh3bjxz8pBxb]{Pfeiffer} is prepared to pay a lot of money for the job, but the Character will need to be careful.

This is common knowledge. Though other colleges are known for their particular sort of aggression, and all serve the military in one capacity or another, the Bright College brings shock and awe to the battlefield like none other. This reputation may lack nuance and be the result of unsophisticated accounts by common soldiers and fraught enemies, but it is steeped in truth. The Bright Wizards often adopt a warlike and fearsome appearance, their staffs made of iron and topped with a brazier ready to wield all-consuming flame.</p>\n<p>The Bright Wind is also associated with emotion. Passion bordering on anger seems to drive Bright Wizards. Part of learning to be a pyromancer is to allow one’s emotions to run free, to enable the gathering of <em>Aqshy</em>. But the key to real power as a Bright Wizard is knowing how to master passion, knowing where to draw the line, and being able to stop oneself from being consumed by such seductive power. Practices to aid control are a large part of the wizard’s training.</p>\n<p>To help with such discipline and self-control and to engender humility, apprentices spend the first period of their apprenticeship undertaking the most menial of chores. They are required to stoke the furnaces that continually burn within the depths of the college, and to scrub the soot encrusted chambers at the heart of the complex. They carry sacks of coal through the building and shovel it into giant hoppers. They must meticulously maintain the mundane paraphernalia that ultimately underlies all the magical functions of the college. This period might be boring and laborious, but it necessitates rest and recuperation which in turn allows an apprentice some time to themselves to savour the delights of Altdorf.</p>\n<div

The manufacture of magic items is covered in detail in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives2.journals.hCDofMZ5QV2Y7z6r]{Archives of the Empire Volume II}. The more common sorts of magic items, those used by wizards in their day-to-day opera-tions, are covered here.</p><h3>Wizard's Robes</h3><p>Wizard’s robes are often confused with the uniforms of the Colleges of Magic. No formal uniforms exist, but each college does teach that certain fabrics, designs, colours, and accessories help channel the Winds of Magic. Most college wizards compromise between practicality, comfort, and efficacy when it comes to their robes. There are three different grades of wizard robes: Practical, Standard, and Elaborate.</p><p>Robes provide a bonus that can be added to any Channelling Tests. Practical Robes confer a bonus of +1 SL, Standard Robes a bonus of +2 SL, and Elaborate Robes a bonus of +3 SL.</p><p>College officials provide robes to mark a wizard’s various degrees of mastery. A Wizard is granted a Practical Robe, a Master Wizard a Standard Robe, and a Wizard Lord is presented with an Elaborate Robe. There is a market for second-hand robes, though it is highly illicit; the prices and availability given in the table below serve as a very rough guide. Robes could also be acquired through the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.gLDW6JBuoYuzCoya.JournalEntryPage.RQLJYU3OyA0WUoPG]{Crafting} Endeavour.</p><p>Chaos sorcerers, necromancers, and daemonologists have their own robe designs, though they must find a willing (and unscrupulous) tailor to make them. Witches and hedge witches do not benefit from robes.</p><table style=\"width:100%;height:68px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Item</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Cost</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Enc</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Availability</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.U2c69atLW5HorHy2]{Practical Robes}</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">1 GC</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">1</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Rare</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.dOlPXXyhnm3XbLOv]{Standard Robes}</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">8 GC</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">2</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Exotic</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.drw5RK1PdZDmlnti]{Elaborate Robes}</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">30 GC</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">4</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Exotic</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A wizard, witch, or hedge witch who wears robes relating to a Lore of Magic they do not practice suffers –1 SL to all Casting and Channelling Tests.</p><p>‘Robes’ may refer to an actual robe but are more likely to be sets of clothing and accessories that embody colours and symbols of a particular Lore of Magic. The descriptions given below are merely a guide to a particular set of robes.</p><p><strong>Practical Robes</strong>: These costumes are inexpensive, comfortable, and relatively plain. A wizard wearing practical robes may even go unrecognised in many situations.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>The practical robes of a Bright Wizard might consist of jerkin, hat, and trousers in various shades of red, orange, and yellow. Embroidered flames may be picked out in gold thread around hems, cuffs, and collars. A small brass key may be worn as an accessory.</em></p><p><strong>Standard Robes</strong>: These costumes are more complex and typically include heavy coats or cloaks and distinctive headwear.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>The standard robes of an Amber Wizard might consist of suede jerkin and trousers, a heavy fur cloak and a headdress made from the bones or hide of a large animal. Feathers, claws, and teeth will be worn openly as ritualistic fetishes, and the arrow symbol of Ghur is plainly engraved into them.</em></p><p><strong>Elaborate Robes</strong>: These costumes are heavy and impractical, often incorporating bulky accessories and reams of cloth woven from magically infused thread. Anyone wearing these robes will be instantly recognised as a wizard.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <em>The elaborate robes of a Light Wizard might consist of several layers of pure white linen. Heavy pieces of jewellery made from gold and inset with small tiles of lapis lazuli are worn at the wrists and neck. A tight skullcap of white calfskin is worn on the head. The costume is finished off with a harness made of golden wire that holds eight candles about the wizard’s shoulders.</em></p><h3>Enchanted Staff</h3><p>Staffs are symbols of power and office to spellcasters, so much so that many of them equip themselves with a mundane staff just to appear serious about their profession. The staff included in a Wizard’s Apprentice’s trappings is a mundane item, but most licensed magisters receive an enchanted staff from their tutor when they end their apprenticeship. Lost or broken staffs can be replaced but require the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.gLDW6JBuoYuzCoya.JournalEntryPage.Z1GbXJsphhaTINRA]{Commission} Endeavour and cost 15 GC.</p><p>An Enchanted Staff is designed in a manner that attracts the Winds of Magic the spellcaster works with. For example, a Bright Wizard’s staff may bear a small brazier and several bronze keys, physically and symbolically embodying Aqshy. A witch’s staff may have rattling bones and cabbalistic symbols intended to draw forth <em>Dhar</em>. An Enchanted Staff may still be used as a Quarterstaff in combat but provides other benefits.</p><p>If a spellcaster bears an Enchanted Staff, they reduce the CN of spells from the associated Lore by 1 to a minimum of 0. This benefit also applies to any Arcane Spells they cast while bearing the Enchanted Staff.</p><p>Elven mages can create Enchanted Staffs that attract multiple winds without attracting <em>Dhar</em>, though the techniques used to do so are jealously guarded by the mage-smiths of Saphery and the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives1.journals.Qz6noKBmpHuoVvlU]{Laurelorn}. This means that wizards who work with more than one wind must either use a staff limited to a single wind or one that attracts <em>Dhar</em>. Enchanted Staffs that attract Dhar are sources of @Corruption[minor]{Minor Exposure to Corruption}. The spellcaster must Test against Corruption once per day while bearing such an Enchanted Staff.</p><p>An enchanted staff acts as an extension of the spellcaster’s body for the purposes of touch-range spells.</p><h3>Scrolls</h3><p>Of the many artefacts wizards use to bind a spell, scrolls are the most common and temporary. Scrolls are typically produced so that a reader, including non-wizards, can cast a spell without having to go through the dangerous business of channelling the Winds of Magic. The magical energy is encoded within sigils and diagrams — all that needs to be done to cast the spell is to read the command words written upon the scroll.</p><p>If the Characters find a scroll, roll twice on the following table. The first roll determines what Lore the spell is from, and the second determines the spell’s maximum Casting Number. The GM should choose an appropriate spell from the Lore, with a CN as close to, but not greater than, the one generated by the roll. If the CN is too low for any spell from the Lore, select the spell with the lowest CN.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.macros.uJELYYUHh2gkveNl]{Generate Spell Scroll}</p><p>Using a scroll that produces a spell from the Lore of Witchcraft counts as a source of @Corruption[minor]{Minor Exposure to Corruption}. Using a scroll that produces a spell from the Lores of Daemonology, Necromancy, or Chaos Magic counts as a source of @Corruption[moderate]{Moderate Exposure to Corruption}.</p><p>In order to use a scroll the wielder must read the command words written upon it. These are usually written in the Magick language but may occasionally be spelt out phonetically in another language if the intended user does not speak Magick. To cast the spell the user must brandish the scroll, read the command words, and pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Language (Magick)</strong> Test.</p><p>If the scroll is intended for a non-wizard, they must pass a <strong>Hard (–20) Language</strong> Test in whatever language the scroll is written in.</p><p>Making this Test is an action. If the user passes this Test, they cast the spell and the scroll is destroyed. If they fail, nothing happens and they can make another attempt on subsequent rounds.</p><p>Miscasts may occur when casting a spell from a scroll, but scrolls are made under controlled conditions so that the spells they contain always count as being cast with @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.YBVrpUHEjohB1H4f.JournalEntryPage.BU7yhLmMdEyvbfkR#ingredients]{ingredients}.</p><h3>Writing Scrolls</h3><p>Scrolls can be created using the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journal-entries.gLDW6JBuoYuzCoya.JournalEntryPage.RQLJYU3OyA0WUoPG]{Crafting} Endeavour as explained in @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-archives2.journals.hCDofMZ5QV2Y7z6r.JournalEntryPage.XcPzYdJYkwok4tlC]{Archives of the Empire Volume II}. A spellcaster can also create a scroll during normal game time through the following process:</p><ul><li><p>They must have access to the spell they wish to bind, either in memory or in a grimoire.</p></li><li><p>The spellcaster must possess a writing kit and piece of parchment or vellum.</p></li><li><p>They must have the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write} Talent.</p></li><li><p>They must make an <strong>Extended Challenging (+0) Art (Writing)</strong> Test to a total of 20 SL</p></li><li><p>They must cast the spell without miscasting. Channelling may be employed as usual. If they succeed, the spell is not cast but is successfully bound to the scroll. If they fail, the scroll is ruined.</p></li></ul><p>Under certain circumstances a mighty wizard has been able to bind a ritual to a scroll, such as Kadon’s Scrolls of Monster Binding. These scrolls are incredibly rare and difficult to produce. If a wizard should attempt to do so, they must follow this process:</p><ul><li><p>They must have access to the ritual they wish to bind, either memorised or in a grimoire.</p></li><li><p>They must have the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.GogGbYxkVdCmiKqf]{Read/Write} Talent.</p></li><li><p>They must satisfy the conditions and ingredients needed. 0 They must make an <strong>Extended Challenging (+0) Art (Writing)</strong> Test to a total of 40 SL.</p></li><li><p>They must cast the ritual without miscasting but the CN of the ritual is doubled to account for the difficulty of fixing a ritual in written form. If they succeed, the ritual is not cast but is successfully bound to the scroll. If they fail, the scroll is ruined and there may be further consequences depending on the Ritual.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Magic Potions","type":"text","_id":"4k3qbP7drfV1mIdr","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Magic potions are concoctions imbued with both magic and the virtues of natural substances. They differ from herbal draughts as magic is required to brew these mixtures, while draughts are created through mundane means.</p><p>This does not mean that only wizards and other highly trained spellcasters brew potions. The Winds of Magic coalesce and concentrate in different materials, plants, and animals. Some apothecaries and alchemists have such a fine understanding of the way magic inhabits physical things that they can take a purely scientific approach to creating magical potions, though these methods may not be as efficacious as those common to witches and wizards.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-core/art/other/herbalism.webp\" width=\"222\" height=\"218\" /></div><p>When a potion is consumed they are expected to provide some benefit to the imbiber. Because many potion ingredients are inherently unstable, and because the arts of preservation in the Old World are poorly understood and inconsistently applied, potions spoil, sometimes with disastrous results. It is not easy to tell if a potion has gone bad, because the natural state of most potions is to smell dubious.</p><p>The following sections describe potion characteristics, the chances a given batch will go bad, the effects when they do go bad, effects for a variety of potions, and rules for how characters can brew them — assuming they wish to try such a dangerous task.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Approaches to Brewing Potions</em></h3><p><em>There are four different approaches to brewing potions, each with their own costs and benefits.</em></p><p><em><strong>Magic</strong>: Magicians brew potions with a few ingredients chosen as much for their totemic value as their actual properties. The effect is fixed into the potion by working the Winds of Magic. This is the default method by which potions are made.</em></p><p><em><strong>Alchemy</strong>: Those with an understanding of alchemy can create potions through careful measurement and combination of minerals. Their potions do not readily spoil but are difficult to make and limited in effect. See @UUID[JournalEntry.4spGTAnh7qc2JDqY.JournalEntryPage.TwuMMg4t9QPf89rT]{Alchemy} for more on alchemy.</em></p><p><em><strong>Herbalism</strong>: Herbs can be gathered and prepared to create a potion, though potions made in this way spoil quickly and have a limited effect.</em></p><p><em><strong>Apothecaries</strong>: Using a combination of tricks from both the alchemical and herbal traditions, apothecaries can create a limited array of potions that tend to be safe, but not very potent in effect.</em></p><p><em>Whichever method the creator uses, they are referred to as the ‘brewer’ for the purposes of these rules.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Potion Characteristics</h3><p>Potions are defined by a variety of characteristics:</p><p><strong>Name</strong>: What the potion is commonly called. When a specific batch of potion is created, the GM should make note of the common name followed by additional information including the potion’s brewer, the method used to create the potion, the season and year the potion was brewed, and the degrees of success the brewer achieved. For example: Potency Draught — Bertoldt the Foetid, Trade: Herbalism, Winter 2515 IC, +2. This provides the GM with the information necessary to work out whether the potion has spoiled.</p><p><strong>Onset Time</strong>: Most potions do not take effect immediately. Onset Time is the amount of time that passes between imbibing the potion and the beginning of its effect.</p><p><strong>Volatility</strong>: A measure of how disastrous the effects are likely to be if the potion is consumed after it has spoiled. Volatility can be described as Minor, Moderate, Major, or Extreme.</p><p><strong>Ingredient Cost</strong>: The amount of ingredients for a batch of the potion cost if purchased on the open market in a large city. Note that the Ingredient Cost is for the ingredients needed if a magician is brewing the potion. Brewers using Trade (Alchemist), Trade (Apothecary), or Trade (Herbalist) have to pay double the listed price.</p><p><strong>Ingredient Locale</strong>: The climates and environments where the potion ingredients can be found if the brewer harvests their own ingredients. Brewers using Trade (Alchemist) cannot harvest ingredients in this way; alchemists must buy their ingredients (unless they also possess the Trade (Herbalist) Skill).</p><p><strong>Ingredient Difficulty</strong>: The difficulty for Tests to find enough ingredients for one batch of the potion in the appropriate locale.</p><p><strong>Creation Difficulty</strong>: The difficulty for Tests to brew a batch of the potion.</p><p><strong>Creation Time</strong>: The amount of time it takes to brew one batch of the potion.</p><p><strong>Effects</strong>: What the potion is supposed to do when someone drinks it. Potions are always limited to affecting the drinker.</p><h3>Using Potions</h3><p>Using a potion is easy — you drink it. Once you’ve swallowed it, the GM rolls on the Potion Spoilage Chance table. This table uses the potion’s age in seasons and the Success Levels scored in brewing it to determine how likely the potion is to have gone bad.</p><p>The GM makes a roll to determine whether the potion has gone bad. If it has not gone bad, the potion takes effect as intended. If the potion has gone bad, the roll also tells the GM whether the potion is utterly spoiled or spoiled but still effective.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img style=\"margin-left:-10px\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/items/vigwort.webp\" width=\"222\" height=\"285\" /></div><p>Degree is the number of Success Levels achieved in brewing. Age is the batch’s age in seasons since brewing. The number before the slash is the chance that the potion is utterly spoiled. The number after the slash is the chance that the potion is spoiled but also effective. Both possibilities are addressed with one die roll.</p><p>If the GM rolls equal to or less than the first number, the potion is utterly spoiled. If the GM rolls equal to or less than the second number, the potion is partially spoiled.</p><p>If the potion is utterly spoiled, the GM rolls on the Potion Spoilage Effects table to determine exactly what happens. If the potion is partially spoiled, the potion has its intended effects but also has a spoilage effect determined by the Potion Spoilage Effects table. The GM should not tell the Player what’s happening during the spoilage determination process, only informing them what happens to their Character. Not knowing whether a potion is about to take effect or rot your guts from the inside out is half the fun.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Potion Spoilage Chance</em></h3><table style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong> </strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"6\"><em><strong>Age in Seasons </strong></em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>SL</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>1</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>2</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>3-4</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>5-8</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>9-16</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>17+</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>0</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>11%/22%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>22%/44%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>33%/66%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>45%/88%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>50%/95%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>65%/95%</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>+1</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>10%/20%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>20%/40%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>30%/60%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>40%/80%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>50%/95%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>50%/95%</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>+2</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>9%/18%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>18%/36%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>27%/54%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>36%/72%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>45%/90%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>50%/95%</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>+3</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>8%/16%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>16%/32%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>24%/48%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>32%/64%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>40%/80%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>50%/95%</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>+4</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>7%/14%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>13%/28%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>21%42%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>28%/56%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>35%/70%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>42%/84%</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>+5</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>6%/12%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>13%/24%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>18%/36%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>24%/48%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>30%/60%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>36%/72%</em></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em><strong>+6</strong></em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>5%/10%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>10%/20%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>15%30%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>20%/40%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>25%/50%</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><em>30%/60%</em></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><h3>Potion Spoilage Effects</h3><p><strong>No Effect</strong>: Even if it should have an effect despite spoiling, the potion has no effect.</p><p><strong>Apparent Death</strong>: The drinker falls into a catatonic trance. Those who inspect the body and pass a <strong>Very Hard (–30) Perception</strong> Test may notice signs of life. The drinker emerges from the trance after [[/r 1d10]] days, which is hopefully soon enough to avoid being interred in a Garden of Morr.</p><p><strong>Bad Breath</strong>: When the drinker exhales, they spew forth an horrific stench of bad eggs or manure. The Minor effect lasts for 1 hour, the Moderate effect lasts for 1 day. During this time any Fellowship-based Tests suffer from –1 SL.</p><p><strong>Bewildered</strong>: The drinker becomes bewildered for [[/r 1d10]] hours. During this period, if they are called on to make decisive actions, they must roll a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test or receive a @Condition[Surprised] Condition.</p><p><strong>Blood Thinning</strong>: The potion has no outward effect, but it interferes with the drinker’s blood. For the next [[/r 1d10]] days, the drinker’s Toughness Bonus is halved (rounding up) for the purposes of resisting damage.</p><p><strong>Bone Rot</strong>: The potion softens the bones in part of the drinker’s body. Roll @Table[hitloc]{Hit Location} to determine the affected area. Whenever that area is struck by an attack or suffers from another source of Damage, the drinker suffers an additional Wound.</p><p><strong>Buboes</strong>: After [[/r 1d10]] hours the drinker develops the @Symptom[Buboes] Symptom as black boils emerge on their armpits, neck, and other tender areas. The buboes last [[/r 1d10]] hours. The Extreme effect lasts for [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><p><strong>Bunions</strong>: After [[/r 1d10]] hours the drinker’s feet erupt in painful horned growths which impose a –1 penalty to the drinker’s Movement. The Minor effect lasts for 1 hour, the Moderate effect lasts for 1 day.</p><p><strong>Colourful Change</strong>: The drinker’s skin changes to a hue of the GM’s choosing. A Minor effect lasts for [[/r 1d10]] hours, a Moderate effect lasts for [[/r 1d10]] days. Those suffering from this malady may be mistaken for a mutant.</p><p><strong>Corruption</strong>: The potion is infused with <em>Dhar</em>. Drinking it counts as @Corruption[major]{Major Exposure to Corruption}.</p><p><strong>Deadly!</strong>: The brew is fatally poisonous. The Character must make an <strong>Impossible (–50) Endurance</strong> Test, receiving two @Condition[Poisoned] Conditions for every –1 SL.</p><p><strong>Delayed</strong>: The spoilage effects are delayed for [[/r 1d10]] days. Roll again on the @Table[potion-spoilage]{Extreme} column to find out what the effect is.</p><p><strong>Drips</strong>: The drinker sweats profusely. A Minor effect lasts for [[/r 1d10]] hours, a Moderate effect lasts for [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><p><strong>Dropsy</strong>: The potion is effective as normal, but after [[/r 1d10]] hours the drinker’s flesh becomes puffy and taut as their body fills with fluid. A Moderate or Major effect imposes –1 SL to Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, and Agility- and Dexterity-based Tests for [[/r 1d10]] hours. An Extreme effect imposes –2 SL to Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, and Agility- and Dexterity-based Tests for 1d10 days.</p><p><strong>Eruptions</strong>: After [[/r 1d10]] hours blisters of pale fluid rise all over the drinker’s skin, itching furiously. The Minor effect lasts for [[/r 1d10]] hours, the Moderate effect lasts for [[/r 1d10]] days. During this time, any Fellowship-based Tests suffer from –1 SL.</p><p><strong>Fungus</strong>: After [[/r 1d10]] days the potion causes the drinker to grow a fungus underneath their skin, causing the affected area to burn and itch. This rash lasts for [[/r 1d10]] days. A Major effect imposes –2 SL to all Agility- and Dexterity-based Tests. An Extreme effect imposes –4 SL to all Agility and Dexterity-based Tests.</p><p><strong>Goitre</strong>: The potion causes a mass of tissue and fluid to build up on the drinker’s neck over a couple of hours. A Minor effect is painful but goes away after a week. A Moderate effect imposes a 1 SL penalty to all Tests for 1 week. People suffering from a goitre may be mistaken for a mutant.</p><p><strong>Gripes</strong>: The potion causes the drinker’s abdomen to clench in knots. The drinker suffers –1 SL to any Willpower-based Tests they make while the cramps last. A Minor effect lasts 1 hour, a Moderate effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] hours, a Major effect lasts 1 day, and an Extreme effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><p><strong>Gut Burn (X)</strong>: After [[/r 1d10]] rounds the potion provokes painful acid reflux. The drinker suffers a Damage X hit that ignores Armour.</p><p><strong>Hair Loss</strong>: A day after drinking the potion, the drinker loses their hair. For a Minor effect it comes out in clumps but grows back normally. For a Moderate effect it grows back with noticeable bald spots.</p><p><strong>Hallucination</strong>: An hour after drinking the potion, the drinker starts to see and hear things that aren’t there. A Minor effect imposes no penalty and the hallucinations stop after an hour. A drinker suffering a Moderate effect must pass an <strong>Easy (+40) Intelligence</strong> Test at the start of each round for the next hour. A drinker suffering a Major effect must pass an <strong>Average (+20) Intelligence</strong> Test at the start of each round for the next [[/r 1d10]] hours. A drinker suffering an Extreme effect must pass an <strong>Challenging (+0) Intelligence</strong> Test at the start of each round for the next day. Characters who fail the Test suffer a @Condition[Stunned] Condition.</p><p><strong>Itchy Bits</strong>: After [[/r 1d10]] rounds the drinker’s skin becomes dry and itchy. For the next hour the drinker suffers from –1 SL to Agility-based tests. The Moderate effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] hours.</p><p><strong>Intoxicating</strong>: The potion has intoxicating effects that may return to haunt the drinker long after they initially took the potion. When the drinker first drinks the potion, they must roll a <strong>Challenging (+0) Consume Alcohol</strong> Test. If they fail, they must roll on the @Table[stinking-drunk]{Stinking Drunk} table. The potion may return to effect the drinker after [[/r 1d10]] days, when they must make an <strong>Average (+20) Consume Alcohol</strong> Test. Then they must make an <strong>Easy (+40) Consume Alcohol</strong> Test every [[/r 1d10]] days. Once the drinker passes 5 Consume Alcohol Tests in succession the potion is finally out of their system.</p><p><strong>Mindslip</strong>: The potion wreaks havoc on the drinker’s mind. Roll on the @Table[mutatemental]{Mental Corruption} Table. For a Moderate effect the drinker suffers the effect for one day. A Major effect lasts one week.</p><p><strong>Oozing Orbs</strong>: The drinker’s eyes begin to sting and weep straw-coloured tears for [[/r 1d10]] hours after they imbibe the potion. The Minor effect imposes a –1 SL penalty to Perception and Ballistic Skill Tests. The Moderate effect imposes a –2 SL penalty.</p><p><strong>Permeating Stench</strong>: The drinker gives off a strange and unsettling odour. This provides the drinker with the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.MVI0lXcg6vvtooAF]{Distracting} Creature Trait which targets both friends and foes. The Minor effect lasts for 1 hour. The Moderate effect lasts for [[/r 1d10]] hours. The Major effect lasts for 1 day. The Extreme effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><p><strong>Poison</strong>: The potion is poisonous. For a Moderate effect, the drinker must pass a <strong>Hard (–20) Endurance</strong> Test or suffer a @Condition[Poisoned] Condition. For a Major effect, the drinker must pass a <strong>Very Hard (–30) Endurance</strong> Test or suffer two @Condition[Poisoned] Conditions. For an Extreme effect, the drinker must pass a <strong>Futile (–40) Endurance</strong> Test or suffer three @Condition[Poisoned] Conditions.</p><p><strong>Potent Brew</strong>: The potion is intoxicating. When the drinker first drinks the potion, they must roll a <strong>Hard (–20) Consume Alcohol</strong> Test. If they fail, they must roll on the @Table[stinking-drunk]{Stinking Drunk} table.</p><p><strong>Ravenous</strong>: The potion fills the drinker with an all-consuming need to eat. For a Minor effect, the drinker must pass an <strong>Average (+20) Cool</strong> Test every round for the next [[/r 1d10]] rounds. If they fail, the drinker must try to eat the nearest organic object, be it friend, foe, a plate of food, or a pile of manure. For a Moderate effect, the drinker must pass a <strong>Challenging (+0) Cool</strong> Test.</p><p><strong>Retching</strong>: After [[/r 1d10]] hours the drinker grows violently ill. Whenever they fail a Test involving physical movement, nausea overwhelms them and they gain a @Condition[Stunned] Condition as they heave and retch. The Moderate effect lasts for 1 day. The Major effect lasts for [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><p><strong>Scabies</strong>: The potion breeds minute vermin that burrow their way through flesh and skin. A Moderate effect is painful and imposes a –1 SL penalty to Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, and Agility- and Dexterity-based Tests for 2d10 hours. A Major effect imposes the same penalty for [[/r 1d10]] days. An Extreme effect imposes a –2 SL penalty to Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, and Agility and Dexterity-based Tests for 2d10 days.</p><p><strong>Sensory Loss</strong>: The potion ravages the drinker’s senses. Roll on the @Table[sensory-loss]{Sensory Loss table}. A Moderate effect results in the loss of a single sense and lasts [[/r 1d10]] minutes, a Major effect results in the loss of two senses and lasts [[/r 1d10]] hours, an Extreme effect results in the loss of three senses and lasts [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><p><strong>Shrieks</strong>: The potion causes the drinker to scream involuntarily. A Moderate effect lasts 1 round. A Major effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] minutes. An Extreme effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] hours after which the drinker may only speak in a hoarse whisper for [[/r 1d10]] days after the screaming fit.</p><p><strong>Spots</strong>: The drinker starts to see spots [[/r 1d10]] minutes after drinking the potion, causing –2 SL to Perception Tests involving vision. The Minor effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] minutes. The Moderate effect lasts for an hour.</p><p><strong>Suppurating Sores</strong>: The potion causes the drinker’s skin to burst and leak a yellowish puss. For a Moderate effect the drinker takes a Damage 4 hit. A Major effect inflicts a Damage 6 hit. The Extreme effect causes the permanent loss of one Wound and inflicts a Damage 8 hit. This Damage ignores Armour.</p><p><strong>Tingles</strong>: The drinker becomes numb. They benefit from +1 SL to any Toughness-based Tests, but suffer –1 SL to any Agility- or Dexterity-based Tests. A Minor effect lasts 1 hour. A Moderate effect lasts 2d10 hours. A Major Effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] days. An Extreme effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] weeks.</p><p><strong>Vapours</strong>: The drinker feels a deep melancholy. Aside from Cool Tests and Tests made to defend themselves from clear danger, the drinker must pass an <strong>Average (+20) Cool</strong> Test before performing any Skill Test. A Minor effect lasts 1 hour, a Moderate effect lasts 1 day.</p><p><strong>Violent Wind</strong>: The drinker suffers a powerful and embarrassing bout of flatulence. At the start of every round they must make a <strong>Difficult (–10) Endurance Test</strong>. If they fail, they gain the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.MVI0lXcg6vvtooAF]{Distracting} Creature Trait, which affects both friends and foes. They must also choose either to make a move or an action in the following round — they may not do both. A Minor effect lasts 1 minute, a Moderate effect lasts 1 hour, a Major effect lasts 1 day, and an Extreme result lasts [[/r 1d10]] days.</p><p><strong>Voice Change</strong>: The drinker’s voice changes pitch, either up or down. This may amuse their companions but has no further effect. A Minor effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] minutes, a Moderate effect lasts [[/r 1d10]] hours.</p><p><strong>Warts</strong>: Small uncomfortable lumps of thick flesh appear on the drinker’s hands, face, and elsewhere. They impose a penalty of –1 SL to Dexterity-based Tests. A Minor effect lasts 1 day, a Moderate effect lasts 1 week.</p><p><strong>Wens</strong>: The potion causes cysts to form on part of the drinker’s body. Roll Hit Location to see where the cysts form. The cysts last for [[/r 1d10]] days. If this location is struck in combat, the drinker must make a <strong>Hard (–20) Endurance Test</strong>. If they fail, they contract the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.diseases.kKccDTGzWzSXCBOb]{Festering Wound} Disease.</p><h3>Brewing Potions</h3><p>Brewing potions is a straightforward process, if time consuming, dangerous, and potentially expensive. Assuming a Character meets the requirements, they must obtain the proper ingredients, spend the requisite amount of time in a laboratory, and make a Test to determine whether the brewing is successful.</p><h4>Requirements</h4><p>To attempt to brew a potion you must meet the requirements listed in the Potion Brewer’s Requirements table.</p><table style=\"width:100%;height:79px\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Approach</strong></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><strong>Requirements</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height:18px\"><td style=\"height:18px;text-align:center\">Magic</td><td style=\"height:18px;text-align:center\">Laboratory, Ingredients, Channelling Skill </td></tr><tr style=\"height:10px\"><td style=\"height:10px;text-align:center\">Alchemy</td><td style=\"height:10px;text-align:center\">Laboratory, Ingredients, Trade (Alchemy) Skill</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Herbalism</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Mortar and Pestle, Cauldron, Ingredients, Trade (Herbalist) Skill</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px\"><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Apothecary</td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Laboratory, Ingredients, Trade (Apothecary) Skill</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Acquiring the space and equipment needed for an Alchemical Laboratory costs 100 GC. A Poor Quality Laboratory costs 50 GC, but imposes –1 SL to Brewing Tests. A Fine Quality Laboratory costs 200 GC and provides +1 SL to Brewing Tests.</p><p>Finally, a brewer must obtain a recipe for the potion they wish to brew. Obtaining a recipe is not easy — those who have them guard them jealously. The price of a recipe must be negotiated with the owner, and there are no set prices. The only guarantee the purchaser has of the recipe’s efficacy is the seller’s reputation.</p><h4>Ingredients</h4><p>The next step is to assemble the ingredients. They may be bought for the listed price for those using the magical approach or double the listed price by those using Trade (Alchemist), Trade (Herbalist), or Trade (Apothecary). Potion ingredients are only available in larger settlements (such as those that are listed as Size 3 or 4 and Wealth 3 or 4 in gazetteers).</p><p>The second option is to search the locale where ingredients grow naturally, spend a week searching and harvesting, and make a Lore (Herbs) Test modified by the Ingredient Difficulty. If the Character succeeds, they find all the potion ingredients they need. If they fail, they don’t but they can try again, if they wish to invest another week in searching.</p><h4>Brewing</h4><p>Once the brewer has assembled the necessary ingredients, they must create their potion before the ingredients spoil. Alchemists who use minerals have a year to create potions, but other brewers only have a month before their ingredients spoil.</p><p>The brewing takes an amount of time equal to the potion’s Creation Time characteristic. The brewer must spend at least three hours each day tending to the process.</p><p>At the end of the Creation Time, the brewer must make a Brewing Test. This is a Skill Test modified according to three factors: the approach the brewer is taking, the volatility of the potion, and the potion’s Creation Difficulty.</p><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>BENEFITS OF </em>SECOND SIGHT</h3><p><em>It helps to be able to see magic while brewing a potion.

A wizard can cast spells by reading directly from the grimoire. This brings its own hazards, such as exposing the treasured tome — it might be disastrous for a wizard to lose or damage their grimoire.</p>\n<p>A spell’s Casting Number doubles when the spellcaster has not memorised the spell, so ideally the wizard must have the time to channel the required power (or have Warpstone to hand), and relative safety from interruption. This best suits wizards looking to cast non-combat spells in a more peaceful environment or one who trusts their companions can keep them safe while channelling the Winds of Magic.</p>\n<h3>Where Are Grimoires Found?</h3>\n<p>The spells within a grimoire could have been handed down or copied from a mentor, purchased from another wizard, or found during an adventure. Many wizards make it their mission to seek out as many spells as possible and add them to their tomes. This is a great source of adventure plots. Wizards, who do not freely allow their spells to be copied, do all they can to keep their grimoires secure and persecute thieves to the fullest of their abilities.</p>\n<h3>The Form of a Grimoire</h3>\n<p>Grimoires come in a variety of formats from thick tomes to a single scroll or leaflet. It is often far more valuable to the wizard than its outward appearance may suggest, although some grimoires are elaborately decorated with gold bookboards and illustrations. A grimoire is personal to the wizard that wrote it and often provides insight into how they think and work, and is likely to be their most treasured possession. Wizards fear other spellcasters could use it against them and only allow those they completely trust to access their grimoire. Carrying a grimoire is punishable as heresy unless the owner is a licensed magister or an apprentice on college grounds or accompanied by a magister.</p>\n<p>Even though different grimoires may contain the same spell, that spell may be written in different ways based on the preferences and approach of the writer. Over time, wizards may change and adapt their own spells as their understanding of the winds and personal beliefs around magic mature.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"sidebar-title no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase\"><em>Using Grimoires</em></h3>\n<div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/spot-book.webp\" width=\"238\" height=\"289\" /></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>A grimoire typically contains four spells or one ritual.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Double the CN of a spell when casting from a grimoire.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>The CN of a ritual is four times what it would normally be if cast from a grimoire.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Spells and rituals in a grimoire are written in </em>Lingua Praestantia<em>.

Many grimoires are notorious because of the power of their creator or because they hold particular knowledge.</p>\n<h4>The Writings of Sedelmann</h4>\n<p>The cover of this thin tome is made of a dark knotted wood, with pages of high-quality vellum. Only small parts of a symbol once etched on the cover are visible. The grimoire was written by G. Sedelmann, a rogue member of the @UUID[JournalEntry.Q9sQhbDN8NUHXYdA.JournalEntryPage.ncaIbmNtJrNfVfZh]{Jade Order}, eventually executed for his crimes. After Sedelmann’s death, his apprentice disappeared from the college and sold the grimoire to fund his new life.</p>\n<p>Within the grimoire Sedelmann inscribed a dozen spells from the Lore of Life. However, they are contained within fevered descriptions of the Realm of Chaos. Each time a spellcaster uses the grimoire to cast a spell, they suffer a @Corruption[minor]{Minor Exposure to Corruption}.</p>\n<h4>The Books of WA</h4>\n<p><em>The Book of WA</em> takes its name from the ripped front page of the grimoire (only the ‘WA’ remains). Much speculation has been made as to the original owner of the book, although scholars have largely agreed that it is the work of multiple hands. Inside the front page says ‘Volume 30’, which has led many to search for the other 29 volumes.</p>\n<p><em>The Book of WA</em> consists of forty pages tied together with string. Inside it contains a range of essays, spells, and jottings. The volumes were compiled around 2300 IC by students, collecting lore that often challenged College dogma. It was outlawed although no-one was punished. Rumours at the time implied that senior wizards had contributed, so they could not risk prosecuting anyone.</p>\n<p>Volume thirty is currently locked away in the personal library of the Supreme Patriarch. Other copies have been split up, with parts used by apprentices ever since.</p>\n<h4>The Hidden Books of Chamon</h4>\n<p><em>The Hidden Books of Chamon</em>, also known, falsely, as the Books of Saturation, are bound in thinly cut oak covered in gold leaf, the symbol of the Golden Order engraved on the cover. Unusually for grimoires, these are magic items in their own right. The text can only be seen when Chamon is strong nearby.</p>\n<p>The books were written in ink devised by Magister Ellinde Kupfer of the Golden Order. Each ink reacts only to its associated Wind. Whatever that wind, tendrils of <em>Chamon</em> faintly circulate the book. The secret of the ink’s creation is said to be lost, but many wizards doubt this. Some mutter that the Grey Order have obtained the secret and use it in their work. The ink and grimoires are much sought after and the colleges send investigators to track down rumours of these works surfacing.</p>\n<p>There are a number of these grimoires known to exist for each college. Some have spells written alongside text within mundane books, with recipes books being a favoured way to disguise their true nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Krampi’s Tome of Power</strong></p>\n<p>Many believe that this book is a legend, a story to warn young apprentices of the dangers of magic. However, scholars believe that this grimoire was written by Alexy Krampi and finished by Felix Ottermann. It was last mentioned in the Middenland folk song A Wizard No More. The book warns <em>‘that only those who can fully control Magick should attempt to wield it’.</em></p>\n<p>Inside the grimoire are written 13 of the most powerful spells. However, one or more of these is a trap. A wizard attempting to cast a spell from this grimoire must make a <strong>Challenging (+0) Lore (Magic)</strong> Test when casting the spell to realise the problem. On a failure, they suffer damage equal to [[/r 1d10]] + the CN of the spell.</p>\n<h3>Random Grimoire</h3>\n<p>To create a random grimoire, roll once for each of the six ocolumns in the table.

Long ago, the High Elves used similar magical gems as part of the ritual that sustains the Great Vortex, and Ulthuan’s mages still inlay them into weapons and armour, including the Sword of Teclis. When the Colleges of Magic were founded, Teclis created the potent Orbs of Sorcery to aid Human wizards with learning a single colour of magic.</p><p>College wizards have tried and failed to replicate the Orbs of Sorcery. Today, every remaining orb is locked in a secure vault. However, no sooner had Teclis left Altdorf than wizards had begun studying their mentor’s artefacts. Theodor Habermas, the Third Patriarch of the Gold College, eventually created a weaker version of Teclis’s orbs. Habermas discovered that Chamon could be concentrated through an arcane process he termed ‘aethyric deposition’. The resultant ‘Philosopher’s Stone’ was used for transmutation experiments and fuelling magical devices.</p><p>Other colleges were skeptical of whether Habermas’s stone justified its intense production process. Though the Philosopher’s Stones were significantly safer than Warpstone, the gems were smaller and more fragile than the Orbs of Sorcery, and their energies expired quickly. Furthermore, Habermas boasted that the yellow stones possessed unproven properties such as granting immortality and transmuting base materials into gold. Nevertheless, the Golden Order continued refining Power Stone production techniques and renamed them ‘Goldstones’.</p><p>As the colleges grew, wizards learned to compress other magical winds using similar techniques. Over the last century, the colleges have constructed tower laboratories on arcane fulcrums and leylines, thus improving production efficiency from weeks to days. The Bright Order now utilises ‘Fire Rubies’ in wands and rings of great destructive potential. Braziers full of Power Stones have even substituted Orbs of Sorcery as fuel for great arcane war machines, such as the Celestial Hurricanum and Luminark of Hysh.</p><table style=\"width:71.8563%;height:153px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Power Stone</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>Wind</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><strong>College</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">True Sapphires</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Azyr</em></td><td style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\">Celestial</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Endstones</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Shyish</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Amethyst</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Ghost Amber</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Ghur</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Amber</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Lumen Stones</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Hysh</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Light</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Fire Rubies</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Aqshy</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Bright</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Goldstone</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Chamon</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Gold</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Crystal Mist</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Ulgu</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Grey</td></tr><tr style=\"height:17px;text-align:center\"><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Vitaellum</td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\"><em>Ghyran</em></td><td style=\"text-align:center;height:17px\">Jade</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Properties of Power Stones</h3><p>Power Stones can fit in the palm of a hand. Shapes and colours vary, however anyone with @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.talents.OEjUvJKi0xmBwbS2]{Second Sight} can identify Power Stones by their inner glow. A Power Stone’s glow fades when its energy expires — typically after a year or two.</p><p><strong>Casting Spells</strong>: Power Stones can be used to improve the Casting Test of an associated Colour Magic spell by +3 SL. The stone must be held in the spellcaster’s hand, and it disintegrates after one use. Power Stones may be used alongside Ingredients if the caster holds them in separate hands.</p><p><strong>Binding Spirits</strong>: Minor Elementals can be bound into Power Stones using the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.QQ5yPFTwzJr9clpK]{Bind Spirit Within Power Stone} ritual. Elementals bound in this way retain their <em>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.028wXnHSYuyKfjJW]{Suffuse with (Wind)}</em> Talent, which now applies to the stone too.</p><p><strong>Magical Devices</strong>: A Power Stone that contains a bound @UUID[JournalEntry.CpVn7Hp5hz7NmpYu.JournalEntryPage.EfqVT5YNmvbLlwkK#minor-elementals]{Minor Elemental} can store a Colour Magic spell associated with the Wind of Magic used to make the stone. Spells cast on the Power Stone are absorbed and imprinted into the elemental’s memory. To release the imprinted spell, a spellcaster must hold the stone and incant a power word, chosen by the spellcaster who imprinted the spell. This does not require a Casting Test. The spell takes effect as if it were cast at +0 SL. Power Stones do not disintegrate after releasing a bound spell. Once the spell is cast, the Elemental forgets it.</p><p><strong>Releasing Bound Spirits</strong>: A Minor Elemental bound within a Power Stone may be released if the stone is shattered. It will obey the spellcaster who bound it if they are in the vicinity, but otherwise reacts as the GM decides. @UUID[JournalEntry.CpVn7Hp5hz7NmpYu.JournalEntryPage.EfqVT5YNmvbLlwkK#minor-elementals]{Minor Elementals} do not live for long.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}},{"sort":500000,"name":"The Marvellous (and Not to Mention Missing) Mystical Miscellany of Mistletaine the Magician","type":"text","_id":"wRFI6tyCfQvZKYWw","title":{"show":false,"level":3},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h3 class=\"no-toc\" style=\"text-align:center\">The Marvellous (and Not to Mention Missing) Mystical Miscellany of Mistletaine the Magician</h3><p><em>One assumes that, if you harbour any ambition of becoming a practitioner of the mystic arts, you are aware of the cautionary tale that is Aygar Mistletaine. If not, I think I can illuminate you. Mistletaine, whilst not the most accomplished of wizards, was not without talent. Born to Norscan adventurers in Lustria, he spent the entirety of his begotten existence in the settlement of Skeggi. There, he trained as a sorcerer. Whilst he had no shortage of talent, he did want for common sense. Instead of following what appeared to be a promising career as a sorcerer, Mistletaine chose to slake his thirst for adventure — and when I say ‘adventure’ what I really mean is tomb robbery. His participation in numerous expeditions to the temples and settlements of the strange cold-blooded inhabitant of Lustria not only made Mistletaine a handsome living, but also gave him plenty of opportunities to collect items of magical esoterica.</em></p><p><em>In the beginning, his collection was restricted to items of Lustrian origin. But, during the course of his dubious exploits he continued to amass a respectable collection of these rare artefacts. His enthusiasm for collecting led him to expand his catalogue by trading with other aficionados. These savants of the sorcerous were located not only in Lustria, but across the seas in the likes of Marienburg, the Empire, and Tilea. As with all collectors, Mistletaine’s fascination with his hoard bordered on mania. We are fortunate that this obsession led him to make not only extensive notes about his artefacts’ individual properties, but also each item’s provenance. For this, at least, I must give him some credit, though I do so begrudgingly. My generosity ends here, however, for, for all his ambition and successes in curating his collection, Mistletaine proved wholly incapable of protecting his growing cache. A sorcerer he may have been, but a curator he was not. This is evident in the sad fact that almost his entire collection was stolen during a raid on his house in Skeggi. The stolen items have since vanished, and I suspect they were either purchased by other collectors or seized by various warlords and warlocks. Mistlemaine himself vanished shortly afterward. The reason for his sudden disappearance remains unknown. Some say he left to look for the items that had been stolen from him. Others say he fled Skeggi to evade his creditors. Whatever the case,</em></p><p><em>he abandoned what was left of his collection, if at that point, it could be called such a thing. Suffice to say, there was very little left when I was contacted and asked to collect the few remaining items. When I arrived, I only found a handful of arcane artefacts and Mistletaine’s catalogue. This document detailed each item that had been in his collection, its history, where he found it, and its features.</em></p><p><em>And so, I offer you a glimpse of my unexpurgated catalogue of Aygar Mistletaine’s magical items. I do so whilst also offering my opinion on the verisimilitude of Mistletaine’s sources (as a scholar he was wanting too). Please be aware, however, that if you are reading this résumé in the hope of finding clues as to the location of those objects which have been stolen, you will be disappointed. If I did know where they were, I must confess I wouldn’t tell you, for, just as many of the following artefacts should never have fallen into the clutches of a dilettante like Mistletaine, nor should they come into the possession of adventurers and opportunists.</em></p><p><em>Item # 1 — The Hammer of Glorri — A magical, talking hammer first created for the adventurer Glorri the Quiet. The runes carved on the hammer imbue it with magical potency when wielded against Goblins and Snotlings. However, it also profanes</em></p><p><em>like an Altdorf stevedore in the presence of said creatures, making it wholly unsuitable for use in adventures and confrontations requiring stealth. Mistletaine’s journals indicate this item was procured in Skeggi from the Dwarven trader Torgrim Torisson.</em></p><p><em>A reputable Dwarf with whom I have enjoyed many a satisfactory transaction, Torisson is believed to have obtained the hammer from another respected dealer of the obscure and desirable, Falstaff of Marienburg. However, the fact Falstaff is one of five dealers who also claim to own the tongue of Abrax the Bloody makes me doubt the true origin of this item.</em></p><p><em>Item # 2 — Eyeglasses of Unknown (but Almost Certainly Dwarf ) Manufacture — When an item doesn’t have an actual name, never mind a receipt of purchase or a hint of history, it is pointless to try and determine its origins. That said, the lenses on this handsome pair of glasses are expertly ground by what was surely a Dwarf optometrist. They are secured in the finest, golden frames. The edges of each lens are augmented by the tiniest Dwarf runes, giving the wearer the most incredible sight.</em></p><p><em>Item # 3 — The Bone of Want — A useful example of hedge wizardry, this small rib bone — such as those found in pigs — constantly replenishes itself. Any meat consumed by the owner regenerates overnight, ready to be enjoyed the nexct day. I have no doubt whatsoever this is a genuine item as I have not only sampled the meat, but have also seen the flesh reappear on the bone. Granted the Bone of Want offers only a few meagre mouthfuls of sustenance, but I have no doubt many a traveller or layman would be deeply grateful for such morsels.</em></p><p><em>Item # 4 — An Ironic Locket — By all accounts Crolin the Warlock was, in actuality, a hedge witch — and a confidence trickster — with delusions of grandeur. He began by selling magical items of dubious reliability to gullible patrons in the Empire. It ended — having fled to Lustria after selling one too many dodgy love potions in Altdorf — with a sudden and bloody demise in a tavern in Skeggi. Before he died, Crolin did manage to con Mistlemaine into buying this piece. A locket, within which is sealed a curl of hair, it possesses the ability to repel vampires. Tales associated with the locket also maintain</em></p><p><em>it was vampiric in nature, requiring a taste of the user’s blood before it would confer its powers. I can find no mention of this item anywhere other than Mistletaine’s catalogue. However, I do know of the antipathy Crolin engendered in those around him, especially other wizards. I am also aware he disappeared some years ago, never to be seen again. It would not surprise me if he had looked to Lustria for a new lease of life. Whether he found it in that verdant hell remains unknown.</em></p><p><em>Item # 5 — Myselia’s Gnarly Staff — Myselia the Hag lived in the undergrowth and ditches of the village of Kleinburg for generations. Serving the community, she becomes a welcomed — if somewhat malodorous — part of the community. Many were the babies she delivered, and many were the ailments she cured. Wandering through the land, she seemed to never tire nor age. Some said she was immortal, while others whispered she was in league with devils and agents of Chaos. Whatever the case, she seemed to lose any vestige of sanity when plague ravaged Kleinburg, decimating its population. Made desperate and distraught with grief, Myselia began to investigate — and experiment with — darker magics. Haunted by the fate of her community, she turned to Necromancy, perhaps somehow hoping she could resurrect the dead of Kleinburg. She vanished shortly afterward, leaving only her gnarly staff and false teeth behind. The former lay in a ditch — the latter were embedded in the staff. The circumstances surrounding her disappearance, and how her precarious gnashers became lodged in her staff, became a mystery. The staff — and accompanying teeth — was next seen in Mistletaine’s collection, where they remained until he too disappeared. A coincidence? Or is the staff somehow cursed…? I am not prone to sentiment, but I do find the story — and corruption — of Myselia the Hag to be tragic and upsetting. A community-minded woman who turned to dark magic in pursuit of a noble cause, she became just another victim of the world’s necromantic energies. When will people learn that no good comes of disturbing the dead? Or resurrecting them.</em></p><p><em>Item # 6 — The Avid Knife — With Dark Elf Corsairs and other cutthroats having stalked Lustria’s verdant land — and preyed on its denizens — for so many years, it follows that the continent would be a treasure trove of Dark Elf artefacts. Many of these artefacts are, of course, focused entirely on the letting of blood. This one, however, is slightly different. Whilst most evil weapons are created to end lives, the Avid Knife was intent on sustaining them. When thrust in a victim, it syphons the lifeforce of its victim into its master. Whilst this is nothing new, the blade would then — having fed whoever wielded the Avid Knife at that time — heal its victim, thus ensuring the poor soul would continue to provide sustenance for its master. The Avid Knife was used for centuries by the disease-ridden hermit that was Korion Deftblade. A Dark Elf cursed by a sorcerer of Nurgle, Deftblade was slowly rotting. His loyal knife, however, did its absolute best to sustain him. Nurgle, however, is not one to let his prey escape so easily. Such was the rapidity with which this curse spread across Deftblade’s body that—no matter how many souls it reaped and fed upon—the Avid Knife could only slow the infection’s advance. The Dark Elf died within a month, his body little more than a gasping, squirming heap of rotting flesh and oozing pus.</em></p><p><em>Item # 7 — The Half-Starved — This thin, curved sword features a simple, undecorated black hilt and a blade of burnished silver. Compared to many Elf weapons it is innocuous. In battle, however, the Half-Starved of Naggaroth is a fearsome weapon. Possessed of hunger, the Half-Starved is a needy, esurient blade that requires nourishment. This hunger is sated — as one might expect — by blood and souls, and it pays handsomely for both. Up to the point of entering Mistletaine’s collection, the Half-Starved had been brandished by a small number of Elf raiders. Each of these enjoyed long and bloody lives. Plying their trade on the seas and coastlines of the Great Ocean, each had a symbiotic relationship with the Half-Starved: if they slaked its thirst for blood, the Half-Starved kept them strong and healthy. However, no matter how each of its owners tried, no matter how many lives it took, the Half-Starved’s craving could never be satisfied. Wanting ever more blood, it would eventually, if not sated, drain its owners entirely, leaving them as little more than desiccated husks. Yet, after each fresh victim came a new owner, desperate to possess the Half-Starved, to benefit from its aid in combat, and to secure the glory to come. All of them are dead now and the Half-Starved — locked in a glass cabinet for decades — must surely feel the most urgent hunger.</em></p><p><em>Intrigued by my offer?

Witches knowingly set about causing or creating curses, often in an act of revenge for some real or perceived slight, but occasionally to cause mischief or chaos, or to further what they believe to be the desire of their masters. The Priest-Kings of Khemri in Nehekhara famously littered their tombs with curses to plague any tomb robber foolish enough to enter, a practice later imitated by necromancers.</p><p>Surprisingly, most curses in the Old World do not cause purely adverse effects but are comprised of boons as well as banes. This is for one very practical reason:Funrel the cursed item must be continually employed for the curse to work its magic on the bearer, and there are no known means, magical or otherwise, of forcing a person to keep possession of an item.</p><p>Curses are often subtle and dual-edged; a benefit is granted, little or great, but at the cost of some larger detriment. Benefits are usually obvious or advertised as such, sometimes even through an inscription upon the item itself. Detrimental effects are more insidious or sporadic, and often, unknown to the victim, triggered by the very benefits the curse has granted. Some of the most deviously cursed items are willingly kept by their owners with full knowledge of all their effects, in a clear-eyed bargain that accepts the bane in exchange for the boon. Such is the lure of the Ruinous Powers.</p><h4>The Cursed Quality</h4><p>Every cursed item has the Cursed Quality, which also makes the item Magical. The most common manifestation is that cursed weapons may damage beings who are only susceptible to Magical attacks, such as beings with the Ethereal Trait. Another side effect is that a cursed item, under careful examination by those with the Sight, appears to draw in and be infused with Dhar, providing a clue to its true nature.</p><p>Each Cursed Item has a Boon, the ability it possesses under normal circumstances; a Bane, the curse that afflicts the item; and a Trigger, the circumstances that bring out the curse.</p><h3>Cursed Items</h3><p>Throughout the history of the Old World, many items were either designed from their inception with a curse in mind or have taken on a curse at some unfortunate time during their existence.</p><div class=\"journal-image float-right\"><img style=\"transform:rotate(45deg);margin-top:50px\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-wom/assets/misc/spot-magic-axe.webp\" width=\"279\" height=\"96\" /></div><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.nmSfTcUvuOjdSuGP]{Axe of Unrelenting Fury}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.2CuklpmPstM3b3YC]{Boots of Sudden Remorse}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.qHgI78qdSj8dJGe0]{Bow of Bloody Empathy}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.DZUNevnfnqy6R7qN]{Brooch of Unwanted Attraction}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.QxAc2Cd3U6INWUzo]{Dagger of Stolen Luck}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.iWk3MPbO98bDJNSR]{Fellowship Sunderer}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.zix8qDd3YVMjXDbw]{Flail of Unsolicited Attention}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.dHtgkuHbDNIBRB2G]{Knuckles of Ignominy}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.cGy8zSaLAqHHB1re]{Mail of Stolen Valour}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.6p6E4JIUchOPj7Dn]{Pistol of Involuntary Solitude}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-wom.items.gYnmIikpSKE1ZABa]{Sword of Holding}</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{}}}],"flags":{"wfrp4e-wom":{"initialization-folder":"Winds of Magic","sort":1200000},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.x6OdswRIafU9qGYs"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"wfrp4e","systemVersion":"6.5.9","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1675377637902,"modifiedTime":1688379903903,"lastModifiedBy":"36O01TtCfYvSkC2g"},"_id":"x6OdswRIafU9qGYs","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"36O01TtCfYvSkC2g":3}}
